        "content": "Question 1 – Capital Structure, Taxes, and Default (60 points)\nNova Steel Inc. is planning a leveraged recapitalization. It issues $300 million of 5-year coupon bonds and uses the proceeds to repurchase equity. The bonds:\n* Face value (par): $300 million\n\n* Coupon rate: 7%, paid annually\n\n* Price at issue: 98% of par\n\n* Maturity: 5 years, no amortization (principal due at maturity)\n\n* Corporate tax rate: 25%\n\nInvestors believe:\n   * Probability of no default over the life of the bond: 88%\n\n   * If Nova defaults at maturity, bondholders expect to recover 55% of face value (inclusive of the final coupon).\n\n   * The risk-free rate is 3% and the market risk premium is 7%.\n\nA. Based on the issue price and promised cashflows, compute the promised annual yield on Nova’s bonds (treat as a 5-year annual coupon bond sold at 98). (15 pts)\nTreat as a standard 5‑year annual coupon bond with promised CFs:\n      * Years 1–4: 21\n\n      * Year 5: 21 + 300 = 321\n\nPrice equation:\n294=∑t=1521(1+y)t+300(1+y)5294 = \\sum_{t=1}^5 \\frac{21}{(1+y)^t} + \\frac{300}{(1+y)^5}294=t=1∑5​(1+y)t21​+(1+y)5300​\nSolve numerically for yyy. (I solved this precisely with a root-finder.)\ny≈7.49%(promised annual YTM)y \\approx 7.49\\% \\quad \\text{(promised annual YTM)}y≈7.49%(promised annual YTM)\nB. Using the probabilities above, compute the expected annual return on the bond from today to maturity. (Assume all default risk is realized at maturity.) (10 pts)\nAssume:\n         * Coupons in years 1–4 are certain (default only at maturity).\n\n         * Only the year‑5 payoff is uncertain.\n\nYear‑5 cash flow:\n            * No default (prob 0.88): receive promised 321\n\n            * Default (prob 0.12): receive 165 (recovery, inclusive of final coupon)\n\nExpected year‑5 payoff:\nE[CF5]=0.88×321+0.12×165=302.28\\mathbb{E}[\\text{CF}_5] = 0.88 \\times 321 + 0.12 \\times 165 = 302.28E[CF5​]=0.88×321+0.12×165=302.28\nExpected‑cash‑flow price equation:\n294=21(1+r)1+21(1+r)2+21(1+r)3+21(1+r)4+302.28(1+r)5294 = \\frac{21}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{21}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{21}{(1+r)^3} + \\frac{21}{(1+r)^4} + \\frac{302.28}{(1+r)^5}294=(1+r)121​+(1+r)221​+(1+r)321​+(1+r)421​+(1+r)5302.28​\nSolve for rrr → the expected annual return on the bond:\nr≈6.38%(expected annual return)r \\approx 6.38\\% \\quad \\text{(expected annual return)}r≈6.38%(expected annual return)\nAs expected, this is below the promised YTM because of default risk.\nC. Using your answer to part B and the CAPM, compute the bond beta. Is it positive or negative? Explain briefly. (10 pts)\nCAPM for the bond:\nE[RD]=rf+βD(E[RM]−rf)E[R_D] = r_f + \\beta_D (E[R_M] - r_f)E[RD​]=rf​+βD​(E[RM​]−rf​)\nWe plug in:\n               * E[RD]≈6.38%E[R_D] \\approx 6.38\\%E[RD​]≈6.38% (from part B)\n\n               * rf=3%r_f = 3\\%rf​=3%\n\n               * E[RM]−rf=7%E[R_M]-r_f = 7\\%E[RM​]−rf​=7%\n\nSo:\nβD=E[RD]−rfE[RM]−rf=0.0638−0.030.07≈0.48\\beta_D = \\frac{E[R_D] - r_f}{E[R_M]-r_f} = \\frac{0.0638 - 0.03}{0.07} \\approx 0.48βD​=E[RM​]−rf​E[RD​]−rf​​=0.070.0638−0.03​≈0.48\nSign: Positive.\nIntuition: the bond pays less precisely in bad states (default), so it is exposed to market risk in the same direction as equity, just to a lesser degree than stock.\n\n\nD. Assuming the tax shield lasts for the full 5 years unless Nova defaults at maturity, compute the NPV of the interest tax shield using a discount rate equal to the expected return on the bond. (15 pts)\nInterest each year (if coupons are paid) is 21, so the annual tax shield is:\nTax shield per year=τ×interest=0.25×21=5.25\\text{Tax shield per year} = \\tau \\times \\text{interest} = 0.25 \\times 21 = 5.25Tax shield per year=τ×interest=0.25×21=5.25\nAssumption from question:\n“Tax shield lasts for the full 5 years unless Nova defaults at maturity.”\nInterpretation:\n                  * Years 1–4: interest definitely paid → tax shields certain: 5.25 each year.\n\n                  * Year 5: if the firm defaults at maturity, we assume no interest is paid, so no tax shield. Otherwise, shield = 5.25.\n\nSo:\nE[TS5]=0.88×5.25+0.12×0=4.62\\mathbb{E}[\\text{TS}_5] = 0.88 \\times 5.25 + 0.12 \\times 0 = 4.62E[TS5​]=0.88×5.25+0.12×0=4.62\nDiscount at the expected return on the bond r≈6.38%r \\approx 6.38\\%r≈6.38%:\nNPV(TS)=∑t=145.25(1+r)t+4.62(1+r)5≈21.4\\text{NPV(TS)} = \\sum_{t=1}^4 \\frac{5.25}{(1+r)^t} + \\frac{4.62}{(1+r)^5} \\approx 21.4NPV(TS)=t=1∑4​(1+r)t5.25​+(1+r)54.62​≈21.4\nSo the NPV of the tax shields is about $21.4m.\nE. A junior analyst instead uses a simple formula: “NPV of tax shield ≈ tax rate × face value of debt” to estimate the value of the tax shield. Will this simple estimate be higher or lower than your answer in D? Explain completely, referencing maturity, default risk, and amortization (or lack thereof). (10 pts)\nAnalyst’s shortcut:\nNPV(TS)≈τ×Face value of debt=0.25×300=75\\text{NPV(TS)} \\approx \\tau \\times \\text{Face value of debt} = 0.25 \\times 300 = 75NPV(TS)≈τ×Face value of debt=0.25×300=75\nThis substantially overestimates the more careful answer (~21.4).\nWhy?\n                     * The shortcut assumes something like permanent, risk‑free debt (debt rolled forever), so the tax shield is an infinite, risk‑free perpetuity.\n\n                     * Here, debt has:\n\n                        * Finite maturity (only 5 years),\n\n                        * Default risk (tax shield can be lost in the default state),\n\n                        * Bullet structure (principal only at maturity, not an interest‑only perpetuity).\n\n                           * Because coupons stop after 5 years and may be lost in bad states, the true PV of tax shields is much smaller than τ×face\\tau \\times \\text{face}τ×face.\n\n________________"

Using your answer to part B and the CAPM, compute the bond beta. Is it positive or negative? Explain briefly. (10 pts)\nCAPM for the bond:\nE[RD]=rf+βD(E[RM]−rf)E[R_D] = r_f + \\beta_D (E[R_M] - r_f)E[RD​]=rf​+βD​(E[RM​]−rf​)\nWe plug in:\n               * E[RD]≈6.38%E[R_D] \\approx 6.38\\%E[RD​]≈6.38% (from part B)\n\n               * rf=3%r_f = 3\\%rf​=3%\n\n               * E[RM]−rf=7%E[R_M]-r_f = 7\\%E[RM​]−rf​=7%\n\nSo:\nβD=E[RD]−rfE[RM]−rf=0.0638−0.030.07≈0.48\\beta_D = \\frac{E[R_D] - r_f}{E[R_M]-r_f} = \\frac{0.0638 - 0.03}{0.07} \\approx 0.48βD​=E[RM​]−rf​E[RD​]−rf​​=0.070.0638−0.03​≈0.48\nSign: Positive.\nIntuition: the bond pays less precisely in bad states (default), so it is exposed to market risk in the same direction as equity, just to a lesser degree than stock.\n\n\nD. Assuming the tax shield lasts for the full 5 years unless Nova defaults at maturity, compute the NPV of the interest tax shield using a discount rate equal to the expected return on the bond. (15 pts)\nInterest each year (if coupons are paid) is 21, so the annual tax shield is:\nTax shield per year=τ×interest=0.25×21=5.25\\text{Tax shield per year} = \\tau \\times \\text{interest} = 0.25 \\times 21 = 5.25Tax shield per year=τ×interest=0.25×21=5.25\nAssumption from question:\n“Tax shield lasts for the full 5 years unless Nova defaults at maturity.”\nInterpretation:\n                  * Years 1–4: interest definitely paid → tax shields certain: 5.25 each year.\n\n                  * Year 5: if the firm defaults at maturity, we assume no interest is paid, so no tax shield. Otherwise, shield = 5.25.\n\nSo:\nE[TS5]=0.88×5.25+0.12×0=4.62\\mathbb{E}[\\text{TS}_5] = 0.88 \\times 5.25 + 0.12 \\times 0 = 4.62E[TS5​]=0.88×5.25+0.12×0=4.62\nDiscount at the expected return on the bond r≈6.38%r \\approx 6.38\\%r≈6.38%:\nNPV(TS)=∑t=145.25(1+r)t+4.62(1+r)5≈21.4\\text{NPV(TS)} = \\sum_{t=1}^4 \\frac{5.25}{(1+r)^t} + \\frac{4.62}{(1+r)^5} \\approx 21.4NPV(TS)=t=1∑4​(1+r)t5.25​+(1+r)54.62​≈21.4\nSo the NPV of the tax shields is about $21.4m.\nE. A junior analyst instead uses a simple formula: “NPV of tax shield ≈ tax rate × face value of debt” to estimate the value of the tax shield. Will this simple estimate be higher or lower than your answer in D? Explain completely, referencing maturity, default risk, and amortization (or lack thereof). (10 pts)\nAnalyst’s shortcut:\nNPV(TS)≈τ×Face value of debt=0.25×300=75\\text{NPV(TS)} \\approx \\tau \\times \\text{Face value of debt} = 0.25 \\times 300 = 75NPV(TS)≈τ×Face value of debt=0.25×300=75\nThis substantially overestimates the more careful answer (~21.4).\nWhy?\n                     * The shortcut assumes something like permanent, risk‑free debt (debt rolled forever), so the tax shield is an infinite, risk‑free perpetuity.\n\n                     * Here, debt has:\n\n                        * Finite maturity (only 5 years),\n\n                        * Default risk (tax shield can be lost in the default state),\n\n                        * Bullet structure (principal only at maturity, not an interest‑only perpetuity).\n\n                           * Because coupons stop after 5 years and may be lost in bad states, the true PV of tax shields is much smaller than τ×face\\tau \\times \\text{face}τ×face.\n\n________________"

One year from today, its asset value (in millions) will depend on the state of the economy:\n                                                      * State 1 (probability 25%): asset value = $200\n\n                                                      * State 2 (25%): asset value = $260\n\n                                                      * State 3 (25%): asset value = $320\n\n                                                      * State 4 (25%): asset value = $380\n\nSummit has the opportunity to invest today in a new distribution hub that costs $50 million. The project has the following value one year from now (in millions), depending on the state:\n                                                         * State 1: project value = $35\n\n                                                         * State 2: project value = $55\n\n                                                         * State 3: project value = $70\n\n                                                         * State 4: project value = $90\n\nAssume a 1-year discount rate of 10% for all assets and projects (no risk differences).\nA. Compute the current value of Summit’s assets without the new project. (10 pts)\nExpected asset value in 1 year:\nE[V1]=0.25(200+260+320+380)=0.25×1160=290\\mathbb{E}[V_1] = 0.25(200 + 260 + 320 + 380) = 0.25 \\times 1160 = 290E[V1​]=0.25(200+260+320+380)=0.25×1160=290\nPresent value:\nVpre=2901.10≈263.64V_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{290}{1.10} \\approx 263.64Vpre​=1.10290​≈263.64\nSo current equity value (no project) is about $263.6m.\nB. Compute the NPV of the project if Summit could fund it without any financing distortions (i.e., ignoring who supplies the cash). (10 pts)\nNow suppose Summit has no cash today and must finance the $50 million by issuing new common equity to outside investors today. The new investors receive a fraction k of the equity; existing shareholders keep 1 − k.\nExpected project value in 1 year:\nE[Vproj,1]=0.25(35+55+70+90)=0.25×250=62.5\\mathbb{E}[V_{proj,1}] = 0.25(35 + 55 + 70 + 90) = 0.25 \\times 250 = 62.5E[Vproj,1​]=0.25(35+55+70+90)=0.25×250=62.5\nPV of project payoff:\nPV(benefits)=62.51.10≈56.82\\text{PV}(benefits)= \\frac{62.5}{1.10} \\approx 56.82PV(benefits)=1.1062.5​≈56.82\nNPV:\nNPV=PV(benefits)−50≈56.82−50=6.82\\text{NPV} = \\text{PV}(benefits) - 50 \\approx 56.82 - 50 = 6.82NPV=PV(benefits)−50≈56.82−50=6.82\nSo the project has positive NPV ≈ $6.8m.\nC. Let the total equity value after the project and equity issue be V_post. Express k as a function of $50 million and V_post (you don’t have to plug in numbers yet). (5 pts)\nLet VpostV_{\\text{post}}Vpost​ be total equity value after the project and equity issue. New investors pay 50 and receive fraction kkk of the equity:\n50=k⋅Vpost⇒k=50Vpost50 = k \\cdot V_{\\text{post}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = \\frac{50}{V_{\\text{post}}}50=k⋅Vpost​⇒k=Vpost​50​\nD.

Compute the wealth of existing shareholders before and after the equity issue and project investment. Does this financing strategy make existing shareholders better or worse off? By how much? (20 pts)\n                                                               * Before project: old shareholders own 100% of firm → wealth\nWold, before=Vpre≈263.64W_{\\text{old, before}} = V_{\\text{pre}} \\approx 263.64Wold, before​=Vpre​≈263.64\n                                                               * After project & equity issue: they own (1−k)(1-k)(1−k) of the larger pie:\nWold, after=(1−k)Vpost=(1−50320.45)320.45=320.45−50≈270.45W_{\\text{old, after}} = (1 - k)V_{\\text{post}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{50}{320.45}\\right) 320.45 = 320.45 - 50 \\approx 270.45Wold, after​=(1−k)Vpost​=(1−320.4550​)320.45=320.45−50≈270.45\nChange in wealth:\nΔWold=270.45−263.64≈6.82\\Delta W_{\\text{old}} = 270.45 - 263.64 \\approx 6.82ΔWold​=270.45−263.64≈6.82\nExactly equal to the project NPV.\nSo this financing strategy makes existing shareholders better off by about $6.8m.\n\n\nF. Interpret your result: who captures the project’s NPV (existing shareholders or new investors), and why? (20 pts)\n                                                                  * Because the equity is fairly priced and investors know the true distribution of outcomes, new investors get zero NPV: they pay $50 for a stake worth $50.\n\n                                                                  * Existing shareholders capture all of the $6.8m NPV.\n\n                                                                  * In this frictionless, symmetric‑information setting, equity financing does not distort investment: managers acting for existing shareholders are happy to accept a positive NPV project, even if they must raise outside equity.\n\nIn more realistic settings, if the firm’s equity were undervalued when issuing new shares, existing shareholders might lose wealth through dilution and could reject a positive NPV project—but that’s not happening in this particular numerical example.\n________________"

      "problem_statement": "(15 pts) In the standard Modigliani-Miller analysis with corporate taxes, debt provides a tax shield because interest is tax-deductible while dividends are not. However, when we introduce personal taxes, debt can become less attractive even when the corporate tax rate is positive. Explain completely: How can personal taxes reduce or even eliminate the tax advantage of debt? In your answer, reference: The tax treatment of interest income vs. equity income at the personal level The combined effect of corporate and personal taxes Under what conditions debt might actually be tax-disadvantaged B) Leverage and Equity Beta (15 pts) Consider two firms with identical assets (same business risk). Firm A is all-equity financed, while Firm B uses 40% debt financing. Firm B's equity beta is 1.5, while Firm A's equity beta is 1.0. Explain: Why does Firm B's equity have a higher beta even though both firms have the same underlying asset risk? Walk through: The relationship between asset beta, debt beta, and equity beta How leverage magnifies equity risk Why this relationship holds even if the asset beta stays constant C) Optimal Leverage in Profitable, Stable Firms (10 pts) Classical trade-off theory suggests firms balance the tax benefits of debt against financial distress costs. Consider a highly profitable firm in a stable industry (e.g., consumer staples, utilities) with: Consistent cash flows Low business risk High tax rates Explain: Why might such a firm optimally choose some leverage instead of zero leverage? Reference: Tax shield benefits Low probability of distress The optimal debt level consideration Question 3 – Multi-State Project and Equity Financing (80 points) Vertex Logistics is an all-equity firm with 5 million shares outstanding. The company operates in a competitive regional market. One year from today, the value of Vertex's existing assets will depend on economic conditions: StateProbabilityAsset Value (millions)Recession30%$150Normal40%$200Boom30%$280 Vertex has identified an opportunity to invest in automated warehouse technology. The project requires an investment of $40 million today. The value of this project one year from now varies by state: StateProbabilityProject Value (millions)Recession30%$20Normal40%$50Boom30%$70 Assumptions: The appropriate discount rate for all assets is 11% (applies to both existing assets and the new project) Vertex currently has no cash and no debt All states are equally observable to managers and investors A) Value the firm's existing assets (10 pts) Compute the current market value of Vertex's assets without undertaking the new project. Show your work. B) Compute the project NPV in an M&M world (10 pts) Calculate the NPV of the automated warehouse project, ignoring any financing frictions. Would this project create value for the firm in an M&M setting? C) Express the equity dilution fraction (5 pts) Vertex must raise $40 million by issuing new common equity to outside investors. Let: V_post = total equity value after the project and equity issue k = fraction of equity sold to new investors Express k as a function of the $40 million raised and V_post. (You don't need to solve for k numerically yet.) D) Compute V_post and solve for k (15 pts) Calculate: V_pre: Current equity value without the project V_post: Equity value with the project and equity financing k: The fraction of equity new investors will demand Show all calculations. E) Analyze old shareholder wealth (20 pts) Compute the wealth of existing shareholders: Before the equity issue and project investment After the equity issue and project investment Does this financing strategy make existing shareholders better or worse off? By how much? F) Interpret the NPV distribution (20 pts) Explain your results from part E: Who captures the project's NPV (existing shareholders or new investors)? Why does this wealth transfer occur? Under what conditions would existing shareholders benefit from undertaking this positive-NPV project? In your answer, reference: Information asymmetry The zero-NPV condition for new equity issues How the project affects firm value across different states Question 4 – Priority, Hybrid Securities, and Risk-Shifting (60 points) Meridian Power has the following capital structure, all maturing in 3 years: Senior Secured Debt: Face value: $180 million Zero-coupon structure (no interest payments; principal only at maturity) Subordinated Bonds: Face value: $60 million Coupon rate: 8% per year Principal and all interest due at maturity (Year 3) Common Equity: Residual claimant Note: For simplicity, assume all coupons and principal are due exactly 3 years from today in a single payment. Ignore previously paid coupons. A) Describe payoffs to debt securities (20 pts) As a function of Meridian's total asset value in 3 years (call it V_A), describe: Senior debt payoff: What does senior debt receive? At what asset value threshold does this change? Subordinated bond payoff: What do subordinated bondholders receive? Identify all asset value thresholds where the payoff changes. Create a clear breakdown showing the payoff in different asset value regions. You may use a table or equations. B) Describe equity payoff (10 pts) As a function of firm asset value (V_A) in 3 years, describe the payoff to common equity holders. Assume absolute priority is strictly enforced (debt is paid in full before equity receives anything). At what asset value does equity begin to receive positive payoffs? C) Convertible preferred vs. subordinated debt (20 pts) The CEO proposes replacing the $60 million subordinated bond with convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred would: Convert into common equity at maturity if firm value exceeds a certain threshold Carry no fixed coupon obligation (eliminating the $14.4 million promised payment) Rank junior to the senior debt but senior to existing common equity if not converted Analyze qualitatively how this change would affect: (i) Financial distress risk: Would the probability of financial distress increase or decrease? Why? (ii) Equity holders' risk-shifting incentives: Would equity holders have more or less incentive to increase firm risk (e.g., take on riskier projects)? Explain completely. In your answer, reference: Fixed claims vs. equity-like claims The option-like nature of equity How payment priorities affect incentives D) Risk-shifting with negative NPV projects (10 pts) Explain why highly levered equity holders might favor risky projects with negative NPV, while debt holders would oppose such projects. Use the option-like nature of levered equity in your explanation. Specifically, address: How equity resembles a call option on firm assets How increasing volatility affects option value Why debt holders and equity holders have conflicting interests",

      "problem_intro": "(15 pts) In the standard Modigliani-Miller analysis with corporate taxes, debt provides a tax shield because interest is tax-deductible while dividends are not. However, when we introduce personal taxes, debt can become less attractive even when the corporate tax rate is positive. Explain completely: How can personal taxes reduce or even eliminate the tax advantage of debt? In your answer, reference: The tax treatment of interest income vs. equity income at the personal level The combined effect of corporate and personal taxes Under what conditions debt might actually be tax-disadvantaged B) Leverage and Equity Beta (15 pts) Consider two firms with identical assets (same business risk). Firm A is all-equity financed, while Firm B uses 40% debt financing. Firm B's equity beta is 1.5, while Firm A's equity beta is 1.0. Explain: Why does Firm B's equity have a higher beta even though both firms have the same underlying asset risk? Walk through: The relationship between asset beta, debt beta, and equity beta How leverage magnifies equity risk Why this relationship holds even if the asset beta stays constant C) Optimal Leverage in Profitable, Stable Firms (10 pts) Classical trade-off theory suggests firms balance the tax benefits of debt against financial distress costs. Consider a highly profitable firm in a stable industry (e.g., consumer staples, utilities) with: Consistent cash flows Low business risk High tax rates Explain: Why might such a firm optimally choose some leverage instead of zero leverage? Reference: Tax shield benefits Low probability of distress The optimal debt level consideration Question 3 – Multi-State Project and Equity Financing (80 points) Vertex Logistics is an all-equity firm with 5 million shares outstanding. The company operates in a competitive regional market. One year from today, the value of Vertex's existing assets will depend on economic conditions: StateProbabilityAsset Value (millions)Recession30%$150Normal40%$200Boom30%$280 Vertex has identified an opportunity to invest in automated warehouse technology. The project requires an investment of $40 million today. The value of this project one year from now varies by state: StateProbabilityProject Value (millions)Recession30%$20Normal40%$50Boom30%$70 Assumptions: The appropriate discount rate for all assets is 11% (applies to both existing assets and the new project) Vertex currently has no cash and no debt All states are equally observable to managers and investors A) Value the firm's existing assets (10 pts) Compute the current market value of Vertex's assets without undertaking the new project. Show your work. B) Compute the project NPV in an M&M world (10 pts) Calculate the NPV of the automated warehouse project, ignoring any financing frictions. Would this project create value for the firm in an M&M setting? C) Express the equity dilution fraction (5 pts) Vertex must raise $40 million by issuing new common equity to outside investors. Let: V_post = total equity value after the project and equity issue k = fraction of equity sold to new investors Express k as a function of the $40 million raised and V_post. (You don't need to solve for k numerically yet.) D) Compute V_post and solve for k (15 pts) Calculate: V_pre: Current equity value without the project V_post: Equity value with the project and equity financing k: The fraction of equity new investors will demand Show all calculations. E) Analyze old shareholder wealth (20 pts) Compute the wealth of existing shareholders: Before the equity issue and project investment After the equity issue and project investment Does this financing strategy make existing shareholders better or worse off? By how much? F) Interpret the NPV distribution (20 pts) Explain your results from part E: Who captures the project's NPV (existing shareholders or new investors)? Why does this wealth transfer occur? Under what conditions would existing shareholders benefit from undertaking this positive-NPV project? In your answer, reference: Information asymmetry The zero-NPV condition for new equity issues How the project affects firm value across different states Question 4 – Priority, Hybrid Securities, and Risk-Shifting (60 points) Meridian Power has the following capital structure, all maturing in 3 years: Senior Secured Debt: Face value: $180 million Zero-coupon structure (no interest payments; principal only at maturity) Subordinated Bonds: Face value: $60 million Coupon rate: 8% per year Principal and all interest due at maturity (Year 3) Common Equity: Residual claimant Note: For simplicity, assume all coupons and principal are due exactly 3 years from today in a single payment. Ignore previously paid coupons. A) Describe payoffs to debt securities (20 pts) As a function of Meridian's total asset value in 3 years (call it V_A), describe: Senior debt payoff: What does senior debt receive? At what asset value threshold does this change? Subordinated bond payoff: What do subordinated bondholders receive? Identify all asset value thresholds where the payoff changes. Create a clear breakdown showing the payoff in different asset value regions. You may use a table or equations. B) Describe equity payoff (10 pts) As a function of firm asset value (V_A) in 3 years, describe the payoff to common equity holders. Assume absolute priority is strictly enforced (debt is paid in full before equity receives anything). At what asset value does equity begin to receive positive payoffs? C) Convertible preferred vs. subordinated debt (20 pts) The CEO proposes replacing the $60 million subordinated bond with convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred would: Convert into common equity at maturity if firm value exceeds a certain threshold Carry no fixed coupon obligation (eliminating the $14.4 million promised payment) Rank junior to the senior debt but senior to existing common equity if not converted Analyze qualitatively how this change would affect: (i) Financial distress risk: Would the probability of financial distress increase or decrease? Why? (ii) Equity holders' risk-shifting incentives: Would equity holders have more or less incentive to increase firm risk (e.g., take on riskier projects)? Explain completely. In your answer, reference: Fixed claims vs. equity-like claims The option-like nature of equity How payment priorities affect incentives D) Risk-shifting with negative NPV projects (10 pts) Explain why highly levered equity holders might favor risky projects with negative NPV, while debt holders would oppose such projects. Use the option-like nature of levered equity in your explanation. Specifically, address: How equity resembles a call option on firm assets How increasing volatility affects option value Why debt holders and equity holders have conflicting interests",

      "problem_statement": "A) Unlimited Liability and Risk Management (15 pts) Compare two business structures: Structure 1: Partnership with Unlimited Liability ●​ Three partners each own 33.3% of a consulting firm ●​ Each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the firm ●​ If the firm cannot pay its debts, creditors can pursue partners' personal assets (homes, savings, etc.) Structure 2: Corporation with Limited Liability ●​ Three shareholders each own 33.3% of a consulting corporation ●​ Shareholders' liability is limited to their investment in the firm ●​ If the firm goes bankrupt, shareholders can lose their investment but creditors cannot pursue personal assets Explain: 1. Different incentives to hedge risks: Suppose the firm faces significant malpractice risk (a large lawsuit could bankrupt the firm). ●​ Partnership (unlimited liability): ○​ How much can each partner lose? ○​ Does this create strong incentives to purchase malpractice insurance? ○​ Would partners want to hedge other firm-specific risks (e.g., customer concentration, key personnel risk)? ○​ Why? ●​ Corporation (limited liability): ○​ How much can each shareholder lose? ○​ Does this create the same incentives to hedge firm-specific risks? ○​ What is the maximum downside for a diversified shareholder? 2. Intuition: Explain in general terms: ●​ Why does unlimited liability make owners more risk-averse? ●​ Why does limited liability allow owners to \"walk away\" from downside risk? ●​ How does this affect the desire to hedge idiosyncratic (diversifiable) risks? 3. Implications: If partnerships have stronger incentives to hedge, what predictions would we make about: ●​ Insurance purchases? ●​ Business practices (conservative vs. aggressive)? ●​ Growth strategies? B) Capital Structure and Required Returns (15 pts) Unlevered Corp currently has no debt (all-equity financed). The company decides to recapitalize: ●​ Issues $200M in debt ●​ Uses the proceeds to repurchase equity Observed changes: ●​ Equity beta increases from 1.0 to 1.4 ●​ Expected return on equity increases from 10% to 13.2% A junior analyst observes: \"Since equity holders now require a 13.2% return instead of 10%, the value of the firm must have fallen because we're discounting cash flows at a higher rate.\" Explain why this reasoning is incorrect: 1. What determines firm value? ●​ Does firm value depend on how it's financed (M&M proposition 1)? ●​ What actually drives firm value? (Expected cash flows from assets, risk of assets) 2. What happens to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)? Before recapitalization: ●​ WACC = r_E = 10% (since 100% equity) After recapitalization (assume D/V = 40%, E/V = 60%, r_D = 5%, no taxes for simplicity): ●​ WACC = r_D × (D/V) + r_E × (E/V) ●​ WACC = 5% × 0.4 + 13.2% × 0.6 = ? How does WACC change? 3. Explain the intuition: ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ The required return on equity increases because equity becomes riskier (more leverage) But cheaper debt partially offsets this The overall cost of capital (WACC) may stay constant or even decrease (with taxes) Firm value depends on WACC and asset cash flows, not just r_E 4. With corporate taxes: If we introduce a 25% tax rate, how does the tax shield affect firm value? ●​ Does leverage increase value through tax shields? ●​ But does this have anything to do with the equity required return increasing? Conclusion: Does an increase in leverage and equity required return, by itself, increase or decrease firm value? Explain completely. C) Dividend Smoothing (10 pts) Empirically, firms tend to maintain stable or gradually increasing dividends rather than letting dividends fluctuate with quarterly earnings. Example: ●​ A firm earns $1.00/share in Q1, $0.60/share in Q2, $1.20/share in Q3, $0.80/share in Q4 ●​ Rather than paying dividends equal to earnings each quarter, the firm pays a stable $0.25/share every quarter Provide two reasons why \"smoothing\" dividends might be valuable: Reason 1 - Signaling: 1.​ What signal does a dividend cut send to the market? ○​ Managers have private information about future prospects ○​ Cutting dividends might signal that management expects earnings will remain low ○​ Market may interpret this negatively 2.​ Why might managers be reluctant to increase dividends temporarily if they can't sustain the increase? ○​ Having to cut later sends a very negative signal ○​ Better to maintain a stable level that's clearly sustainable Reason 2 - Investor Clienteles: 1.​ Who invests in dividend-paying stocks? ○​ Many investors rely on dividends for income (retirees, institutions) ○​ These investors prefer stable, predictable income 2.​ What happens if dividends fluctuate wildly? ○​ Investors who need stable income will avoid the stock ○​ May trade at a discount due to reduced clientele Additional considerations: ●​ Transaction costs: If investors need stable income, fluctuating dividends force them to sell shares to make up shortfalls (costly) ●​ Tax efficiency: Stable dividend policies may allow better tax planning Caveat: In a perfect M&M world, dividend policy is irrelevant. Explain briefly why these considerations represent market frictions that make smoothing potentially valuable despite M&M irrelevance.",

Before recapitalization: ●​ WACC = r_E = 10% (since 100% equity) After recapitalization (assume D/V = 40%, E/V = 60%, r_D = 5%, no taxes for simplicity): ●​ WACC = r_D × (D/V) + r_E × (E/V) ●​ WACC = 5% × 0.4 + 13.2% × 0.6 = ? How does WACC change? 3. Explain the intuition: ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ The required return on equity increases because equity becomes riskier (more leverage) But cheaper debt partially offsets this The overall cost of capital (WACC) may stay constant or even decrease (with taxes) Firm value depends on WACC and asset cash flows, not just r_E 4. With corporate taxes: If we introduce a 25% tax rate, how does the tax shield affect firm value? ●​ Does leverage increase value through tax shields? ●​ But does this have anything to do with the equity required return increasing? Conclusion: Does an increase in leverage and equity required return, by itself, increase or decrease firm value? Explain completely. C) Dividend Smoothing (10 pts) Empirically, firms tend to maintain stable or gradually increasing dividends rather than letting dividends fluctuate with quarterly earnings. Example: ●​ A firm earns $1.00/share in Q1, $0.60/share in Q2, $1.20/share in Q3, $0.80/share in Q4 ●​ Rather than paying dividends equal to earnings each quarter, the firm pays a stable $0.25/share every quarter Provide two reasons why \"smoothing\" dividends might be valuable: Reason 1 - Signaling: 1.​ What signal does a dividend cut send to the market? ○​ Managers have private information about future prospects ○​ Cutting dividends might signal that management expects earnings will remain low ○​ Market may interpret this negatively 2.​ Why might managers be reluctant to increase dividends temporarily if they can't sustain the increase? ○​ Having to cut later sends a very negative signal ○​ Better to maintain a stable level that's clearly sustainable Reason 2 - Investor Clienteles: 1.​ Who invests in dividend-paying stocks? ○​ Many investors rely on dividends for income (retirees, institutions) ○​ These investors prefer stable, predictable income 2.​ What happens if dividends fluctuate wildly? ○​ Investors who need stable income will avoid the stock ○​ May trade at a discount due to reduced clientele Additional considerations: ●​ Transaction costs: If investors need stable income, fluctuating dividends force them to sell shares to make up shortfalls (costly) ●​ Tax efficiency: Stable dividend policies may allow better tax planning Caveat: In a perfect M&M world, dividend policy is irrelevant. Explain briefly why these considerations represent market frictions that make smoothing potentially valuable despite M&M irrelevance.",

      "problem_statement": "(15 pts) In the standard Modigliani-Miller analysis with corporate taxes, debt provides a tax shield because interest is tax-deductible while dividends are not. However, when we introduce personal taxes, debt can become less attractive even when the corporate tax rate is positive. Explain completely: How can personal taxes reduce or even eliminate the tax advantage of debt? In your answer, reference: The tax treatment of interest income vs. equity income at the personal level The combined effect of corporate and personal taxes Under what conditions debt might actually be tax-disadvantaged B) Leverage and Equity Beta (15 pts) Consider two firms with identical assets (same business risk). Firm A is all-equity financed, while Firm B uses 40% debt financing. Firm B's equity beta is 1.5, while Firm A's equity beta is 1.0. Explain: Why does Firm B's equity have a higher beta even though both firms have the same underlying asset risk? Walk through: The relationship between asset beta, debt beta, and equity beta How leverage magnifies equity risk Why this relationship holds even if the asset beta stays constant C) Optimal Leverage in Profitable, Stable Firms (10 pts) Classical trade-off theory suggests firms balance the tax benefits of debt against financial distress costs. Consider a highly profitable firm in a stable industry (e.g., consumer staples, utilities) with: Consistent cash flows Low business risk High tax rates Explain: Why might such a firm optimally choose some leverage instead of zero leverage? Reference: Tax shield benefits Low probability of distress The optimal debt level consideration Question 3 – Multi-State Project and Equity Financing (80 points) Vertex Logistics is an all-equity firm with 5 million shares outstanding. The company operates in a competitive regional market. One year from today, the value of Vertex's existing assets will depend on economic conditions: StateProbabilityAsset Value (millions)Recession30%$150Normal40%$200Boom30%$280 Vertex has identified an opportunity to invest in automated warehouse technology. The project requires an investment of $40 million today. The value of this project one year from now varies by state: StateProbabilityProject Value (millions)Recession30%$20Normal40%$50Boom30%$70 Assumptions: The appropriate discount rate for all assets is 11% (applies to both existing assets and the new project) Vertex currently has no cash and no debt All states are equally observable to managers and investors A) Value the firm's existing assets (10 pts) Compute the current market value of Vertex's assets without undertaking the new project. Show your work. B) Compute the project NPV in an M&M world (10 pts) Calculate the NPV of the automated warehouse project, ignoring any financing frictions. Would this project create value for the firm in an M&M setting? C) Express the equity dilution fraction (5 pts) Vertex must raise $40 million by issuing new common equity to outside investors. Let: V_post = total equity value after the project and equity issue k = fraction of equity sold to new investors Express k as a function of the $40 million raised and V_post. (You don't need to solve for k numerically yet.) D) Compute V_post and solve for k (15 pts) Calculate: V_pre: Current equity value without the project V_post: Equity value with the project and equity financing k: The fraction of equity new investors will demand Show all calculations. E) Analyze old shareholder wealth (20 pts) Compute the wealth of existing shareholders: Before the equity issue and project investment After the equity issue and project investment Does this financing strategy make existing shareholders better or worse off? By how much? F) Interpret the NPV distribution (20 pts) Explain your results from part E: Who captures the project's NPV (existing shareholders or new investors)? Why does this wealth transfer occur? Under what conditions would existing shareholders benefit from undertaking this positive-NPV project? In your answer, reference: Information asymmetry The zero-NPV condition for new equity issues How the project affects firm value across different states Question 4 – Priority, Hybrid Securities, and Risk-Shifting (60 points) Meridian Power has the following capital structure, all maturing in 3 years: Senior Secured Debt: Face value: $180 million Zero-coupon structure (no interest payments; principal only at maturity) Subordinated Bonds: Face value: $60 million Coupon rate: 8% per year Principal and all interest due at maturity (Year 3) Common Equity: Residual claimant Note: For simplicity, assume all coupons and principal are due exactly 3 years from today in a single payment. Ignore previously paid coupons. A) Describe payoffs to debt securities (20 pts) As a function of Meridian's total asset value in 3 years (call it V_A), describe: Senior debt payoff: What does senior debt receive? At what asset value threshold does this change? Subordinated bond payoff: What do subordinated bondholders receive? Identify all asset value thresholds where the payoff changes. Create a clear breakdown showing the payoff in different asset value regions. You may use a table or equations. B) Describe equity payoff (10 pts) As a function of firm asset value (V_A) in 3 years, describe the payoff to common equity holders. Assume absolute priority is strictly enforced (debt is paid in full before equity receives anything). At what asset value does equity begin to receive positive payoffs? C) Convertible preferred vs. subordinated debt (20 pts) The CEO proposes replacing the $60 million subordinated bond with convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred would: Convert into common equity at maturity if firm value exceeds a certain threshold Carry no fixed coupon obligation (eliminating the $14.4 million promised payment) Rank junior to the senior debt but senior to existing common equity if not converted Analyze qualitatively how this change would affect: (i) Financial distress risk: Would the probability of financial distress increase or decrease? Why? (ii) Equity holders' risk-shifting incentives: Would equity holders have more or less incentive to increase firm risk (e.g., take on riskier projects)? Explain completely. In your answer, reference: Fixed claims vs. equity-like claims The option-like nature of equity How payment priorities affect incentives D) Risk-shifting with negative NPV projects (10 pts) Explain why highly levered equity holders might favor risky projects with negative NPV, while debt holders would oppose such projects. Use the option-like nature of levered equity in your explanation. Specifically, address: How equity resembles a call option on firm assets How increasing volatility affects option value Why debt holders and equity holders have conflicting interests",

      "problem_intro": "(15 pts) In the standard Modigliani-Miller analysis with corporate taxes, debt provides a tax shield because interest is tax-deductible while dividends are not. However, when we introduce personal taxes, debt can become less attractive even when the corporate tax rate is positive. Explain completely: How can personal taxes reduce or even eliminate the tax advantage of debt? In your answer, reference: The tax treatment of interest income vs. equity income at the personal level The combined effect of corporate and personal taxes Under what conditions debt might actually be tax-disadvantaged B) Leverage and Equity Beta (15 pts) Consider two firms with identical assets (same business risk). Firm A is all-equity financed, while Firm B uses 40% debt financing. Firm B's equity beta is 1.5, while Firm A's equity beta is 1.0. Explain: Why does Firm B's equity have a higher beta even though both firms have the same underlying asset risk? Walk through: The relationship between asset beta, debt beta, and equity beta How leverage magnifies equity risk Why this relationship holds even if the asset beta stays constant C) Optimal Leverage in Profitable, Stable Firms (10 pts) Classical trade-off theory suggests firms balance the tax benefits of debt against financial distress costs. Consider a highly profitable firm in a stable industry (e.g., consumer staples, utilities) with: Consistent cash flows Low business risk High tax rates Explain: Why might such a firm optimally choose some leverage instead of zero leverage? Reference: Tax shield benefits Low probability of distress The optimal debt level consideration Question 3 – Multi-State Project and Equity Financing (80 points) Vertex Logistics is an all-equity firm with 5 million shares outstanding. The company operates in a competitive regional market. One year from today, the value of Vertex's existing assets will depend on economic conditions: StateProbabilityAsset Value (millions)Recession30%$150Normal40%$200Boom30%$280 Vertex has identified an opportunity to invest in automated warehouse technology. The project requires an investment of $40 million today. The value of this project one year from now varies by state: StateProbabilityProject Value (millions)Recession30%$20Normal40%$50Boom30%$70 Assumptions: The appropriate discount rate for all assets is 11% (applies to both existing assets and the new project) Vertex currently has no cash and no debt All states are equally observable to managers and investors A) Value the firm's existing assets (10 pts) Compute the current market value of Vertex's assets without undertaking the new project. Show your work. B) Compute the project NPV in an M&M world (10 pts) Calculate the NPV of the automated warehouse project, ignoring any financing frictions. Would this project create value for the firm in an M&M setting? C) Express the equity dilution fraction (5 pts) Vertex must raise $40 million by issuing new common equity to outside investors. Let: V_post = total equity value after the project and equity issue k = fraction of equity sold to new investors Express k as a function of the $40 million raised and V_post. (You don't need to solve for k numerically yet.) D) Compute V_post and solve for k (15 pts) Calculate: V_pre: Current equity value without the project V_post: Equity value with the project and equity financing k: The fraction of equity new investors will demand Show all calculations. E) Analyze old shareholder wealth (20 pts) Compute the wealth of existing shareholders: Before the equity issue and project investment After the equity issue and project investment Does this financing strategy make existing shareholders better or worse off? By how much? F) Interpret the NPV distribution (20 pts) Explain your results from part E: Who captures the project's NPV (existing shareholders or new investors)? Why does this wealth transfer occur? Under what conditions would existing shareholders benefit from undertaking this positive-NPV project? In your answer, reference: Information asymmetry The zero-NPV condition for new equity issues How the project affects firm value across different states Question 4 – Priority, Hybrid Securities, and Risk-Shifting (60 points) Meridian Power has the following capital structure, all maturing in 3 years: Senior Secured Debt: Face value: $180 million Zero-coupon structure (no interest payments; principal only at maturity) Subordinated Bonds: Face value: $60 million Coupon rate: 8% per year Principal and all interest due at maturity (Year 3) Common Equity: Residual claimant Note: For simplicity, assume all coupons and principal are due exactly 3 years from today in a single payment. Ignore previously paid coupons. A) Describe payoffs to debt securities (20 pts) As a function of Meridian's total asset value in 3 years (call it V_A), describe: Senior debt payoff: What does senior debt receive? At what asset value threshold does this change? Subordinated bond payoff: What do subordinated bondholders receive? Identify all asset value thresholds where the payoff changes. Create a clear breakdown showing the payoff in different asset value regions. You may use a table or equations. B) Describe equity payoff (10 pts) As a function of firm asset value (V_A) in 3 years, describe the payoff to common equity holders. Assume absolute priority is strictly enforced (debt is paid in full before equity receives anything). At what asset value does equity begin to receive positive payoffs? C) Convertible preferred vs. subordinated debt (20 pts) The CEO proposes replacing the $60 million subordinated bond with convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred would: Convert into common equity at maturity if firm value exceeds a certain threshold Carry no fixed coupon obligation (eliminating the $14.4 million promised payment) Rank junior to the senior debt but senior to existing common equity if not converted Analyze qualitatively how this change would affect: (i) Financial distress risk: Would the probability of financial distress increase or decrease? Why? (ii) Equity holders' risk-shifting incentives: Would equity holders have more or less incentive to increase firm risk (e.g., take on riskier projects)? Explain completely. In your answer, reference: Fixed claims vs. equity-like claims The option-like nature of equity How payment priorities affect incentives D) Risk-shifting with negative NPV projects (10 pts) Explain why highly levered equity holders might favor risky projects with negative NPV, while debt holders would oppose such projects. Use the option-like nature of levered equity in your explanation. Specifically, address: How equity resembles a call option on firm assets How increasing volatility affects option value Why debt holders and equity holders have conflicting interests",

      "problem_statement": "A) Unlimited Liability and Risk Management (15 pts) Compare two business structures: Structure 1: Partnership with Unlimited Liability ●​ Three partners each own 33.3% of a consulting firm ●​ Each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the firm ●​ If the firm cannot pay its debts, creditors can pursue partners' personal assets (homes, savings, etc.) Structure 2: Corporation with Limited Liability ●​ Three shareholders each own 33.3% of a consulting corporation ●​ Shareholders' liability is limited to their investment in the firm ●​ If the firm goes bankrupt, shareholders can lose their investment but creditors cannot pursue personal assets Explain: 1. Different incentives to hedge risks: Suppose the firm faces significant malpractice risk (a large lawsuit could bankrupt the firm). ●​ Partnership (unlimited liability): ○​ How much can each partner lose? ○​ Does this create strong incentives to purchase malpractice insurance? ○​ Would partners want to hedge other firm-specific risks (e.g., customer concentration, key personnel risk)? ○​ Why? ●​ Corporation (limited liability): ○​ How much can each shareholder lose? ○​ Does this create the same incentives to hedge firm-specific risks? ○​ What is the maximum downside for a diversified shareholder? 2. Intuition: Explain in general terms: ●​ Why does unlimited liability make owners more risk-averse? ●​ Why does limited liability allow owners to \"walk away\" from downside risk? ●​ How does this affect the desire to hedge idiosyncratic (diversifiable) risks? 3. Implications: If partnerships have stronger incentives to hedge, what predictions would we make about: ●​ Insurance purchases? ●​ Business practices (conservative vs. aggressive)? ●​ Growth strategies? B) Capital Structure and Required Returns (15 pts) Unlevered Corp currently has no debt (all-equity financed). The company decides to recapitalize: ●​ Issues $200M in debt ●​ Uses the proceeds to repurchase equity Observed changes: ●​ Equity beta increases from 1.0 to 1.4 ●​ Expected return on equity increases from 10% to 13.2% A junior analyst observes: \"Since equity holders now require a 13.2% return instead of 10%, the value of the firm must have fallen because we're discounting cash flows at a higher rate.\" Explain why this reasoning is incorrect: 1. What determines firm value? ●​ Does firm value depend on how it's financed (M&M proposition 1)? ●​ What actually drives firm value? (Expected cash flows from assets, risk of assets) 2. What happens to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)? Before recapitalization: ●​ WACC = r_E = 10% (since 100% equity) After recapitalization (assume D/V = 40%, E/V = 60%, r_D = 5%, no taxes for simplicity): ●​ WACC = r_D × (D/V) + r_E × (E/V) ●​ WACC = 5% × 0.4 + 13.2% × 0.6 = ? How does WACC change? 3. Explain the intuition: ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ The required return on equity increases because equity becomes riskier (more leverage) But cheaper debt partially offsets this The overall cost of capital (WACC) may stay constant or even decrease (with taxes) Firm value depends on WACC and asset cash flows, not just r_E 4. With corporate taxes: If we introduce a 25% tax rate, how does the tax shield affect firm value? ●​ Does leverage increase value through tax shields? ●​ But does this have anything to do with the equity required return increasing? Conclusion: Does an increase in leverage and equity required return, by itself, increase or decrease firm value? Explain completely. C) Dividend Smoothing (10 pts) Empirically, firms tend to maintain stable or gradually increasing dividends rather than letting dividends fluctuate with quarterly earnings. Example: ●​ A firm earns $1.00/share in Q1, $0.60/share in Q2, $1.20/share in Q3, $0.80/share in Q4 ●​ Rather than paying dividends equal to earnings each quarter, the firm pays a stable $0.25/share every quarter Provide two reasons why \"smoothing\" dividends might be valuable: Reason 1 - Signaling: 1.​ What signal does a dividend cut send to the market? ○​ Managers have private information about future prospects ○​ Cutting dividends might signal that management expects earnings will remain low ○​ Market may interpret this negatively 2.​ Why might managers be reluctant to increase dividends temporarily if they can't sustain the increase? ○​ Having to cut later sends a very negative signal ○​ Better to maintain a stable level that's clearly sustainable Reason 2 - Investor Clienteles: 1.​ Who invests in dividend-paying stocks? ○​ Many investors rely on dividends for income (retirees, institutions) ○​ These investors prefer stable, predictable income 2.​ What happens if dividends fluctuate wildly? ○​ Investors who need stable income will avoid the stock ○​ May trade at a discount due to reduced clientele Additional considerations: ●​ Transaction costs: If investors need stable income, fluctuating dividends force them to sell shares to make up shortfalls (costly) ●​ Tax efficiency: Stable dividend policies may allow better tax planning Caveat: In a perfect M&M world, dividend policy is irrelevant. Explain briefly why these considerations represent market frictions that make smoothing potentially valuable despite M&M irrelevance.",

      "problem_intro": "A) Unlimited Liability and Risk Management (15 pts) Compare two business structures: Structure 1: Partnership with Unlimited Liability ●​ Three partners each own 33.3% of a consulting firm ●​ Each partner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the firm ●​ If the firm cannot pay its debts, creditors can pursue partners' personal assets (homes, savings, etc.) Structure 2: Corporation with Limited Liability ●​ Three shareholders each own 33.3% of a consulting corporation ●​ Shareholders' liability is limited to their investment in the firm ●​ If the firm goes bankrupt, shareholders can lose their investment but creditors cannot pursue personal assets Explain: 1. Different incentives to hedge risks: Suppose the firm faces significant malpractice risk (a large lawsuit could bankrupt the firm). ●​ Partnership (unlimited liability): ○​ How much can each partner lose? ○​ Does this create strong incentives to purchase malpractice insurance? ○​ Would partners want to hedge other firm-specific risks (e.g., customer concentration, key personnel risk)? ○​ Why? ●​ Corporation (limited liability): ○​ How much can each shareholder lose? ○​ Does this create the same incentives to hedge firm-specific risks? ○​ What is the maximum downside for a diversified shareholder? 2. Intuition: Explain in general terms: ●​ Why does unlimited liability make owners more risk-averse? ●​ Why does limited liability allow owners to \"walk away\" from downside risk? ●​ How does this affect the desire to hedge idiosyncratic (diversifiable) risks? 3. Implications: If partnerships have stronger incentives to hedge, what predictions would we make about: ●​ Insurance purchases? ●​ Business practices (conservative vs. aggressive)? ●​ Growth strategies? B) Capital Structure and Required Returns (15 pts) Unlevered Corp currently has no debt (all-equity financed). The company decides to recapitalize: ●​ Issues $200M in debt ●​ Uses the proceeds to repurchase equity Observed changes: ●​ Equity beta increases from 1.0 to 1.4 ●​ Expected return on equity increases from 10% to 13.2% A junior analyst observes: \"Since equity holders now require a 13.2% return instead of 10%, the value of the firm must have fallen because we're discounting cash flows at a higher rate.\" Explain why this reasoning is incorrect: 1. What determines firm value? ●​ Does firm value depend on how it's financed (M&M proposition 1)? ●​ What actually drives firm value? (Expected cash flows from assets, risk of assets) 2. What happens to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)? Before recapitalization: ●​ WACC = r_E = 10% (since 100% equity) After recapitalization (assume D/V = 40%, E/V = 60%, r_D = 5%, no taxes for simplicity): ●​ WACC = r_D × (D/V) + r_E × (E/V) ●​ WACC = 5% × 0.4 + 13.2% × 0.6 = ? How does WACC change? 3. Explain the intuition: ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ The required return on equity increases because equity becomes riskier (more leverage) But cheaper debt partially offsets this The overall cost of capital (WACC) may stay constant or even decrease (with taxes) Firm value depends on WACC and asset cash flows, not just r_E 4. With corporate taxes: If we introduce a 25% tax rate, how does the tax shield affect firm value? ●​ Does leverage increase value through tax shields? ●​ But does this have anything to do with the equity required return increasing? Conclusion: Does an increase in leverage and equity required return, by itself, increase or decrease firm value? Explain completely. C) Dividend Smoothing (10 pts) Empirically, firms tend to maintain stable or gradually increasing dividends rather than letting dividends fluctuate with quarterly earnings. Example: ●​ A firm earns $1.00/share in Q1, $0.60/share in Q2, $1.20/share in Q3, $0.80/share in Q4 ●​ Rather than paying dividends equal to earnings each quarter, the firm pays a stable $0.25/share every quarter Provide two reasons why \"smoothing\" dividends might be valuable: Reason 1 - Signaling: 1.​ What signal does a dividend cut send to the market? ○​ Managers have private information about future prospects ○​ Cutting dividends might signal that management expects earnings will remain low ○​ Market may interpret this negatively 2.​ Why might managers be reluctant to increase dividends temporarily if they can't sustain the increase? ○​ Having to cut later sends a very negative signal ○​ Better to maintain a stable level that's clearly sustainable Reason 2 - Investor Clienteles: 1.​ Who invests in dividend-paying stocks? ○​ Many investors rely on dividends for income (retirees, institutions) ○​ These investors prefer stable, predictable income 2.​ What happens if dividends fluctuate wildly? ○​ Investors who need stable income will avoid the stock ○​ May trade at a discount due to reduced clientele Additional considerations: ●​ Transaction costs: If investors need stable income, fluctuating dividends force them to sell shares to make up shortfalls (costly) ●​ Tax efficiency: Stable dividend policies may allow better tax planning Caveat: In a perfect M&M world, dividend policy is irrelevant. Explain briefly why these considerations represent market frictions that make smoothing potentially valuable despite M&M irrelevance.",

C) Hedging vs. Speculation with Interest Rate Swaps (10 pts) TechVenture Corp has $200 million in floating-rate debt (pays LIBOR + 2%). The CFO believes interest rates will fall over the next two years based on his economic analysis. He proposes entering an interest rate swap where TechVenture: ●​ Pays a fixed rate of 4.5% ●​ Receives LIBOR Analyze this proposal: 1.​ Is this primarily a hedging transaction or speculation? Explain. 2.​ Under what circumstances could this swap actually reduce risk and potentially increase firm value? Consider: ○​ The correlation between TechVenture's business and interest rates ○​ Potential financial distress costs ○​ Management's comparative advantage 3.​ What would be different if TechVenture's cash flows naturally increased when interest rates rose (negative correlation)?",

Why? 3.​ What real-world consequences could result from using the wrong discount rate? Specifically, how might this lead to: ○​ Rejecting good projects? ○​ Accepting bad projects? ○​ Changing the firm's risk profile over time? B) Wealth Transfers in Equity Issuance (15 pts) Consider an all-equity firm that issues new shares to finance a positive-NPV project. Suppose: ●​ The equity issue is priced fairly (zero NPV for new investors) ●​ The project has NPV = $20 million ●​ The firm has existing senior claims (e.g., pension obligations, preferred stock) Explain with a numerical example: 1.​ How can the equity issue be zero-NPV for new investors yet still transfer wealth away from old shareholders? 2.​ Where does the project's $20 million NPV go if not to the old shareholders? 3.​ Under what conditions would old shareholders still want to proceed with the equity-financed project? Hint: Consider how the project's value is distributed among all claimants, not just equity. C) Why Not 100% Debt Financing? (10 pts) If interest is tax-deductible and provides a tax shield, why don't all firms with positive-NPV projects use 100% debt financing? Provide at least three distinct reasons, referencing: ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ Financial distress costs Debt overhang and underinvestment Loss of financial flexibility Contracting and agency costs Other real-world considerations Question 3 – Inside vs. Outside Equity Financing (80 points) Riverside Development is a real estate firm owned 100% by three inside investors (founders). The firm currently has no debt and no outside shareholders. Riverside has identified a commercial property development opportunity. Current Situation: ●​ 100% insider ownership ●​ No debt ●​ Founders have sufficient personal wealth to fund the project Future Asset Values (one year from today, in millions): State Probability Existing Assets Project Value Downtur n 25% $120 $50 Stable 50% $180 $90 Growth 25% $240 $140 Project Details: ●​ Required investment today: $80 million ●​ Discount rate: 10% for all cashflows A) Calculate project NPV (15 pts) Compute the NPV of the development project in an M&M world (ignoring financing). Show: 1.​ Expected value of project one year from now 2.​ Present value today 3.​ NPV (PV minus $80 million investment) Is this a value-creating project? B) Inside equity financing (20 pts) Scenario 1: The three founders contribute $80 million from their personal wealth (proportional to their existing ownership stakes). Calculate: 1.​ Value of Riverside before the project 2.​ Value of Riverside after the project (with inside financing) 3.​ Change in insider wealth Show that insiders capture the full NPV when they finance the project themselves. C) Outside equity financing (20 pts) Scenario 2: The founders issue $80 million in new common equity to outside investors. Calculate: 1.​ What fraction k of the post-investment firm do outsiders receive for their $80 million? 2.​ Value of insiders' stake after the outside equity issue 3.​ Change in insider wealth compared to not doing the project D) Compare financing methods (15 pts) Compare insider wealth under the two financing scenarios: Scenario No project Insider Wealth Change from Status Quo Baseline Inside equity Outside equity Which financing method do insiders prefer? Why? E) Explain the underinvestment problem (10 pts) Even though the project has positive NPV, might insiders reject it if they must use outside equity financing? Explain: 1.​ Under what conditions would insiders reject a positive-NPV project? 2.​ Why does this represent a market failure? 3.​ What is this problem called in corporate finance? 4.​ How could debt financing potentially solve this problem? Question 4 – Distress Costs and Payoff Distribution (60 points) Omega Transport operates a fleet of commercial trucks. The company has the following capital structure: Secured Bank Loan: ●​ Face value: $150 million ●​ Collateralized by the truck fleet ●​ Senior to all other claims Unsecured Bond: ●​ Face value: $100 million ●​ Junior to secured debt Common Equity: ●​ Residual claimant All debt matures simultaneously in 2 years. Fire-Sale Discount: If Omega is sold in financial distress, assets realize only 70% of their going-concern value due to: ●​ Forced liquidation timing ●​ Adverse selection (buyers assume the worst) ●​ Thin market for specialized trucking assets A) Illustrate fire-sale impact on claims (20 pts) Suppose Omega's going-concern asset value at maturity would be $280 million, but financial distress forces a sale. Calculate the payoff to each claimant under two scenarios: Scenario 1: No distress (going-concern value = $280M) Claimant Secured bank loan Unsecured bond Payof f Common equity Total $280 M Scenario 2: Distress sale (fire-sale value = 0.70 × $280M = $196M) Claimant Payof f Secured bank loan Unsecured bond Common equity Total $196 M Who bears the $84 million fire-sale cost? B) Ex-ante burden of distress costs (20 pts) Before maturity, when the capital structure is initially created, explain: 1.​ Why are distress costs borne primarily by equity ex-ante, even though in some states other claimants also suffer losses? 2.​ How do debt holders protect themselves from distress costs when they initially lend? 3.​ Use the concept of pricing in expected losses to explain why equity holders effectively bear the cost upfront. C) Link to optimal leverage (20 pts) Using the insights from parts A and B, explain how distress costs affect optimal leverage decisions: 1.​ Why don't firms lever up to extreme levels (e.g., 95% debt)? 2.​ How do the following factors affect optimal leverage: ○​ Probability of distress: What if the business is more volatile? ○​ Magnitude of fire-sale discount: What if assets are more liquid? ○​ Tax benefits: How do these trade off against distress costs? 3.​ Why might firms in different industries have very different leverage ratios?

Under what conditions would old shareholders still want to proceed with the equity-financed project?\nHint: Consider how the project's value is distributed among all claimants, not just equity.\nThis scenario describes the Debt Overhang problem (applied here to senior claims like pensions or preferred stock).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * How wealth is transferred: When risky senior claims exist, a new project—even if positive NPV—might primarily benefit those senior claimants by increasing the firm's solvency and making their claims safer (de-risking). Equity holders provide the funding but only capture the residual value.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Numerical Example (Illustrative): Firm V=$100M. Senior claims Face=$80M, Market Value=$60M (due to risk). Equity=$40M. Project NPV=$20M. Firm value increases to $120M. If the project significantly reduces firm risk, the value of senior claims might increase from $60M to $75M. New Equity Value = $120M - $75M = $45M.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Where the NPV goes: Of the $20M NPV, $15M ($75M-$60M) is captured by the Senior Claimants, and $5M ($45M-$40M) is captured by equity (old + new).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Zero-NPV for new investors, loss for old: New investors buy their share of the $45M equity at a fair price (Zero-NPV). Old shareholders only see a $5M gain, less than the full NPV.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Conditions to proceed: Old shareholders only proceed if the share of the NPV they capture is positive and sufficient. If the overhang is severe, they may reject the project.\nC) Why Not 100% Debt Financing? (10 pts)\nIf interest is tax-deductible and provides a tax shield, why don't all firms with positive-NPV projects use 100% debt financing?\nProvide at least three distinct reasons, referencing:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Financial distress costs\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Debt overhang and underinvestment\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Loss of financial flexibility\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Contracting and agency costs\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Other real-world considerations\nDespite the tax advantages of debt, firms limit leverage due to several critical frictions:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1. Financial Distress Costs: High leverage increases the probability of bankruptcy, which incurs direct costs (legal fees) and significant indirect costs (lost customers, supplier issues, fire sales of assets). These expected costs offset the tax benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2. Agency Costs of Debt (Debt Overhang and Risk-Shifting): Highly levered firms may suffer from underinvestment (Debt Overhang) or take excessive risks (Risk-Shifting) to benefit equity holders at the expense of debt holders.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Loss of Financial Flexibility: Extreme leverage consumes all debt capacity, leaving the firm unable to raise funds during downturns or to finance unexpected opportunities (financial slack).\n________________"

The company is considering two projects: Project A: Low-risk utility infrastructure ●​ Comparable firms in this sector have asset betas of 0.4 ●​ Project NPV using 9% discount rate: -$5 million Project B: High-risk biotech venture ●​ Comparable firms in this sector have asset betas of 1.8 ●​ Project NPV using 9% discount rate: +$10 million Explain: 1.​ What error does TechConglomerate make by using its company-wide WACC for both projects? 2.​ For each project, would using a risk-adjusted discount rate (rather than the 9% WACC) make the project more or less attractive? Why? 3.​ What real-world consequences could result from using the wrong discount rate? Specifically, how might this lead to: ○​ Rejecting good projects? ○​ Accepting bad projects? ○​ Changing the firm's risk profile over time? B) Wealth Transfers in Equity Issuance (15 pts) Consider an all-equity firm that issues new shares to finance a positive-NPV project. Suppose: ●​ The equity issue is priced fairly (zero NPV for new investors) ●​ The project has NPV = $20 million ●​ The firm has existing senior claims (e.g., pension obligations, preferred stock) Explain with a numerical example: 1.​ How can the equity issue be zero-NPV for new investors yet still transfer wealth away from old shareholders? 2.​ Where does the project's $20 million NPV go if not to the old shareholders? 3.​ Under what conditions would old shareholders still want to proceed with the equity-financed project? Hint: Consider how the project's value is distributed among all claimants, not just equity. C) Why Not 100% Debt Financing? (10 pts) If interest is tax-deductible and provides a tax shield, why don't all firms with positive-NPV projects use 100% debt financing? Provide at least three distinct reasons, referencing: ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ ●​ Financial distress costs Debt overhang and underinvestment Loss of financial flexibility Contracting and agency costs Other real-world considerations Question 3 – Inside vs. Outside Equity Financing (80 points) Riverside Development is a real estate firm owned 100% by three inside investors (founders). The firm currently has no debt and no outside shareholders. Riverside has identified a commercial property development opportunity. Current Situation: ●​ 100% insider ownership ●​ No debt ●​ Founders have sufficient personal wealth to fund the project Future Asset Values (one year from today, in millions): State Probability Existing Assets Project Value Downtur n 25% $120 $50 Stable 50% $180 $90 Growth 25% $240 $140 Project Details: ●​ Required investment today: $80 million ●​ Discount rate: 10% for all cashflows A) Calculate project NPV (15 pts) Compute the NPV of the development project in an M&M world (ignoring financing). Show: 1.​ Expected value of project one year from now 2.​ Present value today 3.​ NPV (PV minus $80 million investment) Is this a value-creating project? B) Inside equity financing (20 pts) Scenario 1: The three founders contribute $80 million from their personal wealth (proportional to their existing ownership stakes). Calculate: 1.​ Value of Riverside before the project 2.​ Value of Riverside after the project (with inside financing) 3.​ Change in insider wealth Show that insiders capture the full NPV when they finance the project themselves. C) Outside equity financing (20 pts) Scenario 2: The founders issue $80 million in new common equity to outside investors. Calculate: 1.​ What fraction k of the post-investment firm do outsiders receive for their $80 million? 2.​ Value of insiders' stake after the outside equity issue 3.​ Change in insider wealth compared to not doing the project D) Compare financing methods (15 pts) Compare insider wealth under the two financing scenarios: Scenario No project Insider Wealth Change from Status Quo Baseline Inside equity Outside equity Which financing method do insiders prefer? Why? E) Explain the underinvestment problem (10 pts) Even though the project has positive NPV, might insiders reject it if they must use outside equity financing? Explain: 1.​ Under what conditions would insiders reject a positive-NPV project? 2.​ Why does this represent a market failure? 3.​ What is this problem called in corporate finance? 4.​ How could debt financing potentially solve this problem? Question 4 – Distress Costs and Payoff Distribution (60 points) Omega Transport operates a fleet of commercial trucks. The company has the following capital structure: Secured Bank Loan: ●​ Face value: $150 million ●​ Collateralized by the truck fleet ●​ Senior to all other claims Unsecured Bond: ●​ Face value: $100 million ●​ Junior to secured debt Common Equity: ●​ Residual claimant All debt matures simultaneously in 2 years. Fire-Sale Discount: If Omega is sold in financial distress, assets realize only 70% of their going-concern value due to: ●​ Forced liquidation timing ●​ Adverse selection (buyers assume the worst) ●​ Thin market for specialized trucking assets A) Illustrate fire-sale impact on claims (20 pts) Suppose Omega's going-concern asset value at maturity would be $280 million, but financial distress forces a sale. Calculate the payoff to each claimant under two scenarios: Scenario 1: No distress (going-concern value = $280M) Claimant Secured bank loan Unsecured bond Payof f Common equity Total $280 M Scenario 2: Distress sale (fire-sale value = 0.70 × $280M = $196M) Claimant Payof f Secured bank loan Unsecured bond Common equity Total $196 M Who bears the $84 million fire-sale cost? B) Ex-ante burden of distress costs (20 pts) Before maturity, when the capital structure is initially created, explain: 1.​ Why are distress costs borne primarily by equity ex-ante, even though in some states other claimants also suffer losses? 2.​ How do debt holders protect themselves from distress costs when they initially lend? 3.​ Use the concept of pricing in expected losses to explain why equity holders effectively bear the cost upfront. C) Link to optimal leverage (20 pts) Using the insights from parts A and B, explain how distress costs affect optimal leverage decisions: 1.​ Why don't firms lever up to extreme levels (e.g., 95% debt)? 2.​ How do the following factors affect optimal leverage: ○​ Probability of distress: What if the business is more volatile? ○​ Magnitude of fire-sale discount: What if assets are more liquid? ○​ Tax benefits: How do these trade off against distress costs? 3.​ Why might firms in different industries have very different leverage ratios?

Explain how differences in growth vs. risk can justify Company B trading at twice Company A's multiple: 1.​ Growth perspective: How would higher expected future growth justify a higher P/CF? 2.​ Risk perspective: How would lower systematic risk (beta) justify a higher P/CF? 3.​ Provide a numerical example: Assume both firms have current CF = $100M.

Under what conditions would old shareholders still want to proceed with the equity-financed project?\nHint: Consider how the project's value is distributed among all claimants, not just equity.\nThis scenario describes the Debt Overhang problem (applied here to senior claims like pensions or preferred stock).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * How wealth is transferred: When risky senior claims exist, a new project—even if positive NPV—might primarily benefit those senior claimants by increasing the firm's solvency and making their claims safer (de-risking). Equity holders provide the funding but only capture the residual value.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Numerical Example (Illustrative): Firm V=$100M. Senior claims Face=$80M, Market Value=$60M (due to risk). Equity=$40M. Project NPV=$20M. Firm value increases to $120M. If the project significantly reduces firm risk, the value of senior claims might increase from $60M to $75M. New Equity Value = $120M - $75M = $45M.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Where the NPV goes: Of the $20M NPV, $15M ($75M-$60M) is captured by the Senior Claimants, and $5M ($45M-$40M) is captured by equity (old + new).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Zero-NPV for new investors, loss for old: New investors buy their share of the $45M equity at a fair price (Zero-NPV).

Financial Distress Costs: High leverage increases the probability of bankruptcy, which incurs direct costs (legal fees) and significant indirect costs (lost customers, supplier issues, fire sales of assets). These expected costs offset the tax benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2. Agency Costs of Debt (Debt Overhang and Risk-Shifting): Highly levered firms may suffer from underinvestment (Debt Overhang) or take excessive risks (Risk-Shifting) to benefit equity holders at the expense of debt holders.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Loss of Financial Flexibility: Extreme leverage consumes all debt capacity, leaving the firm unable to raise funds during downturns or to finance unexpected opportunities (financial slack).\n________________"

Consider: ○​ Investment opportunities ○​ Financing costs ○​ Tax efficiency 2.​ What might explain the investors' pressure for dividends? Consider: ○​ Agency conflicts ○​ Signaling ○​ Clientele preferences 3.​ What would you recommend? Is there a middle ground? B) P/CF Multiples Across Firms (15 pts) Two firms in the same industry have very different Price-to-Cash-Flow multiples: ●​ CompanyA: P/CF = 12× ●​ Company B: P/CF = 24× Both firms have positive cash flows and similar current profitability. Explain how differences in growth vs. risk can justify Company B trading at twice Company A's multiple: 1.​ Growth perspective: How would higher expected future growth justify a higher P/CF? 2.​ Risk perspective: How would lower systematic risk (beta) justify a higher P/CF? 3.​ Provide a numerical example: Assume both firms have current CF = $100M. Using a simple valuation formula, show how different assumptions about growth and/or discount rates could yield the observed multiples. C) Hedging and Underinvestment (10 pts) ChemCorp is near financial distress with debt coming due in one year. The company has valuable growth opportunities but may not have sufficient cash to invest if commodity prices fall.

      "problem_statement": "This question explores how equity's option-like properties change with leverage levels. Background: ●​ Equity can be viewed as a call option on firm assets ●​ Debt can be viewed as risk-free bonds minus a put option Consider three firms with identical assets (value = $500M, volatility = 30%) but different leverage: ●​ Firm L (Low Leverage): Debt face value = $100M ●​ Firm M (Medium Leverage): Debt face value = $300M ●​ Firm H (High Leverage): Debt face value = $450M All debt matures in 3 years. A) Explain option nature with low leverage (15 pts) For Firm L (debt = $100M, assets = $500M): 1.​ Describe equity as a call option: ○​ What is the strike price? ○​ What is the underlying asset? ○​ When is the option exercised? 2.​ Is this option deep in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money? 3.​ How does equity behave? ○​ Does it move nearly 1:1 with assets (high delta)? ○​ Is it highly sensitive to volatility (high vega)? Explain why low leverage makes equity behave more like owning the underlying assets. B) Explain option nature with high leverage (15 pts) For Firm H (debt = $450M, assets = $500M): 1.​ Describe equity as a call option: ○​ What is the strike price? ○​ What is the underlying asset? 2.​ Is this option deep in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money? 3.​ How does equity behave differently from Firm L? ○​ Sensitivity to asset value changes (delta) ○​ Sensitivity to volatility (vega) Explain why high leverage makes equity behave more option-like. C) Reactions to risk increases (20 pts) Suppose each firm has an opportunity to undertake a risky project that: ●​ Increases asset volatility from 30% to 50% ●​ Has zero NPV (doesn't change expected asset value) Analyze which firm's equity holders would most favor this project: 1.​ Firm L (low leverage): Would equity holders favor increasing volatility? Why or why not? 2.​ Firm M (medium leverage): How does the answer differ from Firm L? 3.​ Firm H (high leverage): How do these equity holders view volatility increases? Explain using option pricing intuition: ●​ How does volatility affect call option values? ●​ How does moneyness (in/at/out-of-the-money) affect vega? D) Implications for corporate governance (10 pts) Based on your analysis: 1.​ Why might high leverage lead to excessive risk-taking by equity holders? 2.​ How could debt covenants address this problem? 3.​ What types of covenant restrictions would be most valuable?

How do debt holders protect themselves from distress costs when they initially lend?\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Use the concept of pricing in expected losses to explain why equity holders effectively bear the cost upfront.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4. Why equity bears the cost ex-ante: Although debtholders suffer the losses in the actual event of distress, they anticipate this risk when they initially lend.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       5. How debt holders protect themselves: Lenders demand a higher promised interest rate (credit spread) or a lower purchase price for the debt to compensate for the expected losses in distress (including fire-sale discounts).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       6. Pricing in expected losses: By pricing this risk into the debt contract, the higher financing cost reduces the firm's value today. As equity holders are the residual claimants, this reduction in firm value (due to the anticipated distress costs) is borne by the equity holders ex-ante (upfront).\n\n\nC) Link to optimal leverage (20 pts)\nUsing the insights from parts A and B, explain how distress costs affect optimal leverage decisions:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1.

Background: ●​ Equity can be viewed as a call option on firm assets ●​ Debt can be viewed as risk-free bonds minus a put option Consider three firms with identical assets (value = $500M, volatility = 30%) but different leverage: ●​ Firm L (Low Leverage): Debt face value = $100M ●​ Firm M (Medium Leverage): Debt face value = $300M ●​ Firm H (High Leverage): Debt face value = $450M All debt matures in 3 years. A) Explain option nature with low leverage (15 pts) For Firm L (debt = $100M, assets = $500M): 1.​ Describe equity as a call option: ○​ What is the strike price? ○​ What is the underlying asset? ○​ When is the option exercised? 2.​ Is this option deep in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money? 3.​ How does equity behave? ○​ Does it move nearly 1:1 with assets (high delta)? ○​ Is it highly sensitive to volatility (high vega)? Explain why low leverage makes equity behave more like owning the underlying assets. B) Explain option nature with high leverage (15 pts) For Firm H (debt = $450M, assets = $500M): 1.​ Describe equity as a call option: ○​ What is the strike price? ○​ What is the underlying asset? 2.​ Is this option deep in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money? 3.​ How does equity behave differently from Firm L? ○​ Sensitivity to asset value changes (delta) ○​ Sensitivity to volatility (vega) Explain why high leverage makes equity behave more option-like. C) Reactions to risk increases (20 pts) Suppose each firm has an opportunity to undertake a risky project that: ●​ Increases asset volatility from 30% to 50% ●​ Has zero NPV (doesn't change expected asset value) Analyze which firm's equity holders would most favor this project: 1.​ Firm L (low leverage): Would equity holders favor increasing volatility? Why or why not? 2.​ Firm M (medium leverage): How does the answer differ from Firm L? 3.​ Firm H (high leverage): How do these equity holders view volatility increases? Explain using option pricing intuition: ●​ How does volatility affect call option values? ●​ How does moneyness (in/at/out-of-the-money) affect vega? D) Implications for corporate governance (10 pts) Based on your analysis: 1.​ Why might high leverage lead to excessive risk-taking by equity holders? 2.​ How could debt covenants address this problem? 3.​ What types of covenant restrictions would be most valuable?

Consider: ●​ Survivorship bias ●​ Time-varying risk premiums ●​ Ex-post vs. ex-ante returns ●​ Sample period selection 2.​ Why is CAPM-based approach generally preferred? 3.​ What are the limitations of the CAPM approach? B) Share Repurchases Above Intrinsic Value (15 pts) TechGrowth's management believes the stock is undervalued at $50 per share, with intrinsic value of $70. However, activist investors pressure management to repurchase shares at the current market price of $50. Later, it turns out management was wrong—the stock was actually overvalued. The true intrinsic value was only $40 per share. Analyze: 1.​ How does repurchasing at $50 (when intrinsic value is $40) affect shareholders who: ○​ Sell their shares in the repurchase? ○​ Retain their shares? 2.​ Provide a numerical example with: ○​ Firm value = $400M (true) ○​ 10M shares outstanding ○​ Firm repurchases 2M shares at $50/share Calculate value per share for remaining shareholders before and after the repurchase. 3.​ What does this illustrate about the importance of price in repurchases?

Under what conditions would old shareholders still want to proceed with the equity-financed project?\nHint: Consider how the project's value is distributed among all claimants, not just equity.\nThis scenario describes the Debt Overhang problem (applied here to senior claims like pensions or preferred stock).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * How wealth is transferred: When risky senior claims exist, a new project—even if positive NPV—might primarily benefit those senior claimants by increasing the firm's solvency and making their claims safer (de-risking). Equity holders provide the funding but only capture the residual value.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Numerical Example (Illustrative): Firm V=$100M. Senior claims Face=$80M, Market Value=$60M (due to risk). Equity=$40M. Project NPV=$20M. Firm value increases to $120M. If the project significantly reduces firm risk, the value of senior claims might increase from $60M to $75M. New Equity Value = $120M - $75M = $45M.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Where the NPV goes: Of the $20M NPV, $15M ($75M-$60M) is captured by the Senior Claimants, and $5M ($45M-$40M) is captured by equity (old + new).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Zero-NPV for new investors, loss for old: New investors buy their share of the $45M equity at a fair price (Zero-NPV).

Financial Distress Costs: High leverage increases the probability of bankruptcy, which incurs direct costs (legal fees) and significant indirect costs (lost customers, supplier issues, fire sales of assets). These expected costs offset the tax benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2. Agency Costs of Debt (Debt Overhang and Risk-Shifting): Highly levered firms may suffer from underinvestment (Debt Overhang) or take excessive risks (Risk-Shifting) to benefit equity holders at the expense of debt holders.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Loss of Financial Flexibility: Extreme leverage consumes all debt capacity, leaving the firm unable to raise funds during downturns or to finance unexpected opportunities (financial slack).\n________________"

Consider: ●​ Survivorship bias ●​ Time-varying risk premiums ●​ Ex-post vs. ex-ante returns ●​ Sample period selection 2.​ Why is CAPM-based approach generally preferred? 3.​ What are the limitations of the CAPM approach? B) Share Repurchases Above Intrinsic Value (15 pts) TechGrowth's management believes the stock is undervalued at $50 per share, with intrinsic value of $70. However, activist investors pressure management to repurchase shares at the current market price of $50. Later, it turns out management was wrong—the stock was actually overvalued. The true intrinsic value was only $40 per share. Analyze: 1.​ How does repurchasing at $50 (when intrinsic value is $40) affect shareholders who: ○​ Sell their shares in the repurchase? ○​ Retain their shares? 2.​ Provide a numerical example with: ○​ Firm value = $400M (true) ○​ 10M shares outstanding ○​ Firm repurchases 2M shares at $50/share Calculate value per share for remaining shareholders before and after the repurchase. 3.​ What does this illustrate about the importance of price in repurchases? C) Interest Rate Changes and Firm Value (10 pts) Suppose the risk-free rate increases from 3% to 4%, but: ●​ The firm's beta stays the same ●​ The market risk premium stays the same ●​ The firm's expected cash flows don't change Explain: 1.​ Why would the firm's value still decrease? 2.​ Walk through the mechanism: ○​ How does the discount rate change? ○​ How does this affect PV of cash flows? 3.​ Give a specific numerical example using the Gordon Growth Model: V = CF / (r - g) Show how a 1% increase in r affects value.",

Current Situation: ●​ Assets: $400M ●​ Asset volatility: 25% ●​ Management has discretion over derivative positions A) Design a genuine hedge (15 pts) Suppose SpeculCorp's asset value is highly correlated with oil prices (positive correlation). Design a derivative hedge: 1.​ What position should SpeculCorp take (long/short)? 2.​ What specific derivative would work? (futures, options, swaps?) 3.​ How does this reduce firm risk? Calculate: ●​ How would a 20% drop in oil prices affect un-hedged assets? ●​ How would the derivative position offset this? B) Speculative derivative gamble (15 pts) Instead, suppose management takes a large speculative position: ●​ Buys oil futures (betting on price increase) ●​ Notional value: $200M ●​ Not correlated with existing business risk Scenario analysis if oil prices rise 30%: 1.​ Gain on derivative position 2.​ Approximate new total asset value 3.​ Who benefits most—debt or equity? Why? Scenario if oil prices fall 30%: 1.​ Loss on derivative position 2.​ New total asset value 3.​ Who bears most of the loss—debt or equity? Why? C) Explain asymmetric payoffs (20 pts) Explain why equity holders might favor speculative derivative positions: 1.​ If the bet pays off: ○​ How much goes to equity vs. debt? ○​ Use specific numbers from part B 2.​ If the bet fails: ○​ How are losses distributed? ○​ Can equity lose more than 100% of their current value? 3.​ Expected value: ○​ Even if the speculation has negative expected value, why might equity holders favor it? ○​ Reference the option-like nature of levered equity D) Distinguishing hedge from speculation (10 pts) From an outside observer's perspective (debt holders, regulators, board): 1.​ How can you distinguish genuine hedging from speculation? Consider: ●​ Correlation with business risks ●​ Position size relative to exposures ●​ Economic rationale 2.​ What contractual restrictions could limit speculative derivative use? 3.​ How effective are these restrictions likely to be?",

How do debt holders protect themselves from distress costs when they initially lend?\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Use the concept of pricing in expected losses to explain why equity holders effectively bear the cost upfront.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4. Why equity bears the cost ex-ante: Although debtholders suffer the losses in the actual event of distress, they anticipate this risk when they initially lend.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       5. How debt holders protect themselves: Lenders demand a higher promised interest rate (credit spread) or a lower purchase price for the debt to compensate for the expected losses in distress (including fire-sale discounts).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       6. Pricing in expected losses: By pricing this risk into the debt contract, the higher financing cost reduces the firm's value today. As equity holders are the residual claimants, this reduction in firm value (due to the anticipated distress costs) is borne by the equity holders ex-ante (upfront).\n\n\nC) Link to optimal leverage (20 pts)\nUsing the insights from parts A and B, explain how distress costs affect optimal leverage decisions:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1.

Why might firms in different industries have very different leverage ratios? Provide two specific industry examples.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Why not extreme leverage? According to the Trade-Off Theory, firms balance tax benefits against expected distress costs. At extreme leverage, the expected costs of distress (Probability × Magnitude) rise sharply and eventually outweigh the marginal tax benefits of debt.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Factors affecting optimal leverage:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Probability of distress (Volatility): If the business is more volatile, the probability of distress is higher, leading to lower optimal leverage.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Magnitude of fire-sale discount (Liquidity): If assets are illiquid (high discount, like specialized trucks), distress is costlier, leading to lower optimal leverage.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Tax benefits: Higher tax rates increase the value of the tax shield, pushing optimal leverage higher.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Industry examples:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * High Leverage: Real Estate or Utilities.

The calculated NPV(TS) is $9.67 Million. The approximation is vastly higher.\nWhy they differ:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1. Amortizing Structure: τD assumes $200M is outstanding constantly. Here, the debt balance declines rapidly, significantly reducing the interest expense and tax shields in later years.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2. Finite Maturity: τD assumes perpetual debt. A 5-year stream of benefits is worth far less than a perpetuity due to the time value of money.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3. Default Risk: τD ignores default risk. The probability of default reduces the expected value of the tax shields, as they are lost if the firm liquidates.\n\n\n________________"

A) Calculate relative tax advantage of debt (15 pts) The relative tax advantage of debt can be expressed as: Tax Advantage = 1 - [(1 - τc)(1 - τe)] / (1 - τi) Where: ●​ τc = corporate tax rate ●​ τe = effective personal tax rate on equity ●​ τi = personal tax rate on interest income Since equity returns primarily come as capital gains: ●​ τe = τcg = 15% Calculate: 1.​ After-tax income from $1 of corporate earnings if distributed as interest 2.​ After-tax income from $1 of corporate earnings if retained (equity) 3.​ The relative tax advantage of debt Is debt tax-favored in this jurisdiction? B) Qualitative comparison to MM with only corporate taxes (15 pts) In the standard Modigliani-Miller analysis with corporate taxes only: ●​ Tax advantage of debt = τc = 30% ●​ Optimal leverage → 100% debt Explain how introducing personal taxes changes this: 1.​ Why is the tax advantage of debt less than 30% in part A? 2.​ Under what conditions could personal taxes completely eliminate the tax advantage of debt? 3.​ Could personal taxes make equity tax-favored? What would need to be true? C) Optimal leverage implications (15 pts) Given the tax parameters above: 1.​ Should firms still use some debt? Why or why not? 2.​ How would optimal leverage compare to the \"corporate taxes only\" case? 3.​ What other factors (besides taxes) affect optimal leverage? D) Cross-country variation (15 pts) Different countries have different tax systems: Country A: High corporate tax (35%), low personal tax on interest (10%) Country B: Low corporate tax (15%), high personal tax on interest (40%) Analyze: 1.​ In which country does debt have a larger tax advantage? 2.​ Calculate the relative tax advantage of debt in each country (assume τe = 15% in both) 3.​ Would you expect to see different capital structures across these countries?

How could debt financing potentially solve this problem?\nWhich method do insiders prefer? In this scenario (assuming fair pricing and no information asymmetry), insiders are indifferent between the two financing methods, as they capture the full NPV in both cases.\nConditions for rejection: Insiders might reject a positive-NPV project if they must use outside equity financing under asymmetric information. If insiders know the firm is undervalued by the market, issuing equity forces them to sell shares cheaply.\nWhy rejection occurs: If the wealth transfer to new investors (dilution cost due to undervaluation) exceeds the NPV captured by insiders, they will reject the project.\nMarket Failure & Name: This is a market failure where value creation is blocked by information frictions, known as the Adverse Selection problem (Myers-Majluf).\nDebt Financing: Debt is less information-sensitive than equity. Issuing debt avoids the dilution associated with selling undervalued equity, potentially solving this underinvestment problem (Pecking Order Theory).\n________________"

      "problem_statement": "A) Positive Alpha and Market Efficiency (15 pts) TechGrowth Inc. is a publicly traded technology company. An analyst runs a CAPM regression on the stock's historical returns and estimates: ●​ Beta = 1.1 ●​ Risk-free rate = 4% ●​ Market risk premium = 6% CAPM prediction: Expected return = 4% + 1.1 × 6% = 10.6% However, TechGrowth's long-run realized average return has been 13.6%, implying an alpha of +3.0%. Answer the following: 1.​ What does positive alpha mean in CAPM terms? ○​ Define alpha formally ○​ Explain what it means for a stock to deliver returns above its CAPM prediction 2.​ Interpretation 1 - True Mispricing: If markets are inefficient, what does this positive alpha suggest? ○​ Is the stock undervalued or overvalued? ○​ What trading strategy would exploit this? ○​ Why might the mispricing persist? 3.​ Interpretation 2 - Measurement Issues: If markets are efficient, what might explain the apparent alpha? ○​ Sampling error / luck over the estimation period? ○​ Risk factors not captured by the single-factor CAPM (e.g., size, value, momentum)? ○​ Errors in measuring beta? Discuss: How should a rational investor interpret this positive alpha? What additional analysis would help distinguish between these interpretations? B) Debt vs. Equity Financing Under Trade-Off Theory (15 pts) Reliable Industries has a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and very low current leverage (D/E = 0.1). The company has identified a positive-NPV expansion project requiring $100 million in financing. Financing options: ●​ All equity: Issue $100M in new common stock ●​ All debt: Issue $100M in bonds ●​ Mixed: Some combination Under trade-off theory, analyze the financing decision: Part 1 - Why some debt might be preferred to all equity: 1.​ What is the tax advantage of debt? ○​ If the corporate tax rate is 25% and the debt coupon rate is 6%, calculate the annual tax shield from $100M of debt ○​ How does this tax shield benefit shareholders? 2.​ Why is the expected cost of financial distress likely low for Reliable Industries? ○​ Current low leverage ○​ Stable cash flows ○​ Strong balance sheet 3.​ Conclusion: Why does trade-off theory suggest that some debt is optimal? Part 2 - Why all debt could be suboptimal: 1.​ What happens to distress costs as leverage increases? ○​ Probability of distress ○​ Expected magnitude of distress costs 2.​ At some leverage level, what relationship holds at the optimum? ○​ Marginal benefit of tax shields ○​ Marginal cost of expected distress 3.​ Conclusion: Why might 100% debt financing exceed the optimal leverage ratio? Overall answer: Explain why the trade-off theory predicts an interior optimum (some debt, but not all debt). C) Fixed vs. Floating Rate Debt (10 pts) Companies can choose between: ●​ Fixed-rate debt: Interest rate locked in (e.g., 6% for 5 years) ●​ Floating-rate debt: Interest rate adjusts with market rates (e.g., LIBOR + 2%) Scenario 1 - Highly cyclical firm (e.g., automotive manufacturer): This firm's cash flows are: ●​ High during economic booms ●​ Low during recessions Interest rates tend to be: ●​ High during booms (Fed tightens) ●​ Low during recessions (Fed eases) Explain: 1.​ Why might this firm prefer fixed-rate debt? ○​ How does floating-rate debt create additional risk? ○​ When would interest payments be highest? ○​ When would cash flows be lowest? ○​ Why does this correlation increase distress risk? Scenario 2 - Very stable firm (e.g., regulated utility): This firm has: ●​ Predictable cash flows ●​ Low correlation with economic cycles ●​ Minimal distress risk Explain: 1.​ Why might this firm be more willing to use floating-rate debt? ○​ Is the mismatch between rates and cash flows a major concern? ○​ What are potential benefits of floating-rate debt (e.g., typically lower initial rates, flexibility)? Conclude: How should the relationship between a firm's cash flows and interest rate cycles influence the fixed vs. floating decision? Question 3 – Multi-State Project and All-Debt Financing (80 points) Zen Transport operates a regional logistics network and is financed entirely with equity. The company has 8 million shares outstanding. One year from today, the value of Zen's existing assets depends on economic conditions: State Probability Asset Value Weak Economy 40% $160 million Strong Economy 60% $240 million New Project Opportunity: Zen can invest $60 million today in new routing optimization software. One year from today, this project will be worth: State Probability Project Value Weak Economy 40% $50 million Strong Economy 60% $90 million Assumptions: ●​ Required return for all assets and projects: 10% ●​ Zen currently has no cash and no debt A) Value existing assets today (10 pts) Calculate the current market value of Zen's existing assets (before any project decision). Expected asset value one year from now: E[Asset Value] = ? Present value today: V_Assets = E[Asset Value] / (1 + r) = ? B) Compute project NPV ignoring financing (10 pts) In an M&M world with no financing frictions, calculate the project's NPV. Expected project value one year from now: E[Project Value] = ? Present value today: PV_Project = ? NPV: NPV = PV_Project - $60M investment = ? Is this a value-creating project? C) All-debt financing scenario (15 pts) Zen has no cash, so it must raise external financing. The company decides to finance the entire $60 million project by issuing debt. Debt structure: ●​ One-year zero-coupon bond ●​ Face value: $60 million ●​ Assume the debt is truly risk-free (no default in either state) Calculate: 1.​ New firm value (existing assets + project): ○​ In weak economy: Total assets = ? ○​ In strong economy: Total assets = ? ○​ Expected total asset value = ? ○​ PV of total firm today = ? 2.​ Debt value today: Since the debt is risk-free and pays $60M in one year: ○​ V_Debt = $60M / (1.10) = ? 3.​ Wait - if the debt is truly risk-free, should we discount at 10%? Reconsider: if risk-free, discount at risk-free rate. But the problem says required return for all assets is 10%, which suggests we should use 10% or clarify. For this problem, assume we use 10% as stated, but note this creates an arbitrage if the debt is truly risk-free. 4.​ Equity value today: ○​ V_Equity = V_Firm - V_Debt = ? D) Wealth comparison for existing shareholders (15 pts) Before the debt-financed project: ●​ Total equity value = V_Assets (from part A) ●​ Value per share = V_Assets / 8M shares ●​ Existing shareholders own 100% of equity After the debt-financed project: ●​ Total equity value = V_Firm - V_Debt (from part C) ●​ Existing shareholders still own 100% of equity (no equity dilution with debt financing) ●​ Value per share = New V_Equity / 8M shares Calculate: Scenario Equity Value Chan ge Before (no project) After (debt-financed project) Net change Are existing shareholders better or worse off? Explain: ●​ How much of the project's NPV do they capture? ●​ Why is all-debt financing attractive when there's no equity dilution? E) Risky debt and risk-shifting incentives (30 pts) Now suppose the debt is risky rather than risk-free. Specifically: ●​ Face value still $60 million ●​ In the weak economy (assets = $160M + $50M = $210M), debt is easily repaid ●​ But default becomes possible if Zen subsequently takes on additional risks Analyze qualitatively: Part 1 - Shareholder wealth with risky debt (10 pts): If default becomes possible in some scenarios: 1.​ How does the debt value change? ○​ Would risky debt trade at less than the risk-free value? ○​ Why? 2.​ How does equity value change? ○​ If V_Firm is unchanged but V_Debt decreases, what happens to V_Equity? ○​ Do shareholders benefit from the debt being risky? Part 2 - Value of the project to shareholders (10 pts): Suppose the project primarily benefits the weak state (improving outcomes when times are bad): 1.​ Who benefits most from projects that improve bad-state outcomes? ○​ Debt holders (who care about downside protection)? ○​ Equity holders (who care about upside)? 2.​ Could shareholders actually capture less than the full project NPV? ○​ If the project reduces default risk, who captures that value? Part 3 - Risk-shifting incentives (10 pts): With risky debt outstanding, explain: 1.​ What is risk-shifting? ○​ Why might shareholders favor risky projects even with negative NPV? ○​ How does leverage make equity behave like an option? 2.​ How does this affect project choice? ○​ Might shareholders reject the safe, positive-NPV routing software? ○​ Might they prefer a risky, negative-NPV speculative venture instead? ○​ How does the option-like nature of equity explain this? 3.​ Debt covenants: ○​ How could debt covenants restrict risk-shifting? ○​ Give one specific example of a covenant that would help",

      "problem_intro": "A) Positive Alpha and Market Efficiency (15 pts) TechGrowth Inc. is a publicly traded technology company. An analyst runs a CAPM regression on the stock's historical returns and estimates: ●​ Beta = 1.1 ●​ Risk-free rate = 4% ●​ Market risk premium = 6% CAPM prediction: Expected return = 4% + 1.1 × 6% = 10.6% However, TechGrowth's long-run realized average return has been 13.6%, implying an alpha of +3.0%. Answer the following: 1.​ What does positive alpha mean in CAPM terms? ○​ Define alpha formally ○​ Explain what it means for a stock to deliver returns above its CAPM prediction 2.​ Interpretation 1 - True Mispricing: If markets are inefficient, what does this positive alpha suggest? ○​ Is the stock undervalued or overvalued? ○​ What trading strategy would exploit this? ○​ Why might the mispricing persist? 3.​ Interpretation 2 - Measurement Issues: If markets are efficient, what might explain the apparent alpha? ○​ Sampling error / luck over the estimation period? ○​ Risk factors not captured by the single-factor CAPM (e.g., size, value, momentum)? ○​ Errors in measuring beta? Discuss: How should a rational investor interpret this positive alpha? What additional analysis would help distinguish between these interpretations? B) Debt vs. Equity Financing Under Trade-Off Theory (15 pts) Reliable Industries has a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, and very low current leverage (D/E = 0.1). The company has identified a positive-NPV expansion project requiring $100 million in financing. Financing options: ●​ All equity: Issue $100M in new common stock ●​ All debt: Issue $100M in bonds ●​ Mixed: Some combination Under trade-off theory, analyze the financing decision: Part 1 - Why some debt might be preferred to all equity: 1.​ What is the tax advantage of debt? ○​ If the corporate tax rate is 25% and the debt coupon rate is 6%, calculate the annual tax shield from $100M of debt ○​ How does this tax shield benefit shareholders? 2.​ Why is the expected cost of financial distress likely low for Reliable Industries? ○​ Current low leverage ○​ Stable cash flows ○​ Strong balance sheet 3.​ Conclusion: Why does trade-off theory suggest that some debt is optimal? Part 2 - Why all debt could be suboptimal: 1.​ What happens to distress costs as leverage increases? ○​ Probability of distress ○​ Expected magnitude of distress costs 2.​ At some leverage level, what relationship holds at the optimum? ○​ Marginal benefit of tax shields ○​ Marginal cost of expected distress 3.​ Conclusion: Why might 100% debt financing exceed the optimal leverage ratio? Overall answer: Explain why the trade-off theory predicts an interior optimum (some debt, but not all debt). C) Fixed vs. Floating Rate Debt (10 pts) Companies can choose between: ●​ Fixed-rate debt: Interest rate locked in (e.g., 6% for 5 years) ●​ Floating-rate debt: Interest rate adjusts with market rates (e.g., LIBOR + 2%) Scenario 1 - Highly cyclical firm (e.g., automotive manufacturer): This firm's cash flows are: ●​ High during economic booms ●​ Low during recessions Interest rates tend to be: ●​ High during booms (Fed tightens) ●​ Low during recessions (Fed eases) Explain: 1.​ Why might this firm prefer fixed-rate debt? ○​ How does floating-rate debt create additional risk? ○​ When would interest payments be highest? ○​ When would cash flows be lowest? ○​ Why does this correlation increase distress risk? Scenario 2 - Very stable firm (e.g., regulated utility): This firm has: ●​ Predictable cash flows ●​ Low correlation with economic cycles ●​ Minimal distress risk Explain: 1.​ Why might this firm be more willing to use floating-rate debt? ○​ Is the mismatch between rates and cash flows a major concern? ○​ What are potential benefits of floating-rate debt (e.g., typically lower initial rates, flexibility)? Conclude: How should the relationship between a firm's cash flows and interest rate cycles influence the fixed vs. floating decision? Question 3 – Multi-State Project and All-Debt Financing (80 points) Zen Transport operates a regional logistics network and is financed entirely with equity. The company has 8 million shares outstanding. One year from today, the value of Zen's existing assets depends on economic conditions: State Probability Asset Value Weak Economy 40% $160 million Strong Economy 60% $240 million New Project Opportunity: Zen can invest $60 million today in new routing optimization software. One year from today, this project will be worth: State Probability Project Value Weak Economy 40% $50 million Strong Economy 60% $90 million Assumptions: ●​ Required return for all assets and projects: 10% ●​ Zen currently has no cash and no debt A) Value existing assets today (10 pts) Calculate the current market value of Zen's existing assets (before any project decision). Expected asset value one year from now: E[Asset Value] = ? Present value today: V_Assets = E[Asset Value] / (1 + r) = ? B) Compute project NPV ignoring financing (10 pts) In an M&M world with no financing frictions, calculate the project's NPV. Expected project value one year from now: E[Project Value] = ? Present value today: PV_Project = ? NPV: NPV = PV_Project - $60M investment = ? Is this a value-creating project? C) All-debt financing scenario (15 pts) Zen has no cash, so it must raise external financing. The company decides to finance the entire $60 million project by issuing debt. Debt structure: ●​ One-year zero-coupon bond ●​ Face value: $60 million ●​ Assume the debt is truly risk-free (no default in either state) Calculate: 1.​ New firm value (existing assets + project): ○​ In weak economy: Total assets = ? ○​ In strong economy: Total assets = ? ○​ Expected total asset value = ? ○​ PV of total firm today = ? 2.​ Debt value today: Since the debt is risk-free and pays $60M in one year: ○​ V_Debt = $60M / (1.10) = ? 3.​ Wait - if the debt is truly risk-free, should we discount at 10%? Reconsider: if risk-free, discount at risk-free rate. But the problem says required return for all assets is 10%, which suggests we should use 10% or clarify. For this problem, assume we use 10% as stated, but note this creates an arbitrage if the debt is truly risk-free. 4.​ Equity value today: ○​ V_Equity = V_Firm - V_Debt = ? D) Wealth comparison for existing shareholders (15 pts) Before the debt-financed project: ●​ Total equity value = V_Assets (from part A) ●​ Value per share = V_Assets / 8M shares ●​ Existing shareholders own 100% of equity After the debt-financed project: ●​ Total equity value = V_Firm - V_Debt (from part C) ●​ Existing shareholders still own 100% of equity (no equity dilution with debt financing) ●​ Value per share = New V_Equity / 8M shares Calculate: Scenario Equity Value Chan ge Before (no project) After (debt-financed project) Net change Are existing shareholders better or worse off? Explain: ●​ How much of the project's NPV do they capture? ●​ Why is all-debt financing attractive when there's no equity dilution? E) Risky debt and risk-shifting incentives (30 pts) Now suppose the debt is risky rather than risk-free. Specifically: ●​ Face value still $60 million ●​ In the weak economy (assets = $160M + $50M = $210M), debt is easily repaid ●​ But default becomes possible if Zen subsequently takes on additional risks Analyze qualitatively: Part 1 - Shareholder wealth with risky debt (10 pts): If default becomes possible in some scenarios: 1.​ How does the debt value change? ○​ Would risky debt trade at less than the risk-free value? ○​ Why? 2.​ How does equity value change? ○​ If V_Firm is unchanged but V_Debt decreases, what happens to V_Equity? ○​ Do shareholders benefit from the debt being risky? Part 2 - Value of the project to shareholders (10 pts): Suppose the project primarily benefits the weak state (improving outcomes when times are bad): 1.​ Who benefits most from projects that improve bad-state outcomes? ○​ Debt holders (who care about downside protection)? ○​ Equity holders (who care about upside)? 2.​ Could shareholders actually capture less than the full project NPV? ○​ If the project reduces default risk, who captures that value? Part 3 - Risk-shifting incentives (10 pts): With risky debt outstanding, explain: 1.​ What is risk-shifting? ○​ Why might shareholders favor risky projects even with negative NPV? ○​ How does leverage make equity behave like an option? 2.​ How does this affect project choice? ○​ Might shareholders reject the safe, positive-NPV routing software? ○​ Might they prefer a risky, negative-NPV speculative venture instead? ○​ How does the option-like nature of equity explain this? 3.​ Debt covenants: ○​ How could debt covenants restrict risk-shifting? ○​ Give one specific example of a covenant that would help",
