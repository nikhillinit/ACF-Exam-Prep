"title": "Why Does Leverage Increase Equity Beta?",
"concept": "Relationship between leverage, asset beta, and equity beta.",
"archetype": "A1-CapitalStructure",
"analogy": "Equity as a residual claim riding in the back of a leveraged roller coaster.",
"explanation": [
"Think of the firm’s assets as a business that earns a risky return r_A. That business can be financed with some combination of debt and equity.",
"Debt holders get a relatively fixed promised payment (coupons and principal). Equity holders get whatever is left over—good or bad—after paying debt. That 'whatever is left' is the definition of a residual claim.",
"When the firm does well (assets above the promised debt payment), debt gets its fixed payment and all of the upside goes to equity. A small percentage increase in asset value can translate into a much larger percentage increase in equity value because the debt slice is fixed.",
"When the firm does poorly (assets close to or below the debt promise), debt still gets paid first. Equity absorbs all of the downside. A modest drop in asset value can translate into a huge negative equity return because debt is senior and equity is last in line.",
"Mathematically, equity is a levered claim on the assets:\n  r_A = (D / (D + E)) * r_D + (E / (D + E)) * r_E.\nRewriting, you get:\n  r_E = r_A + (D / E) * (r_A - r_D).\nThe term (D / E) * (r_A - r_D) is the leverage kicker: the higher the D/E ratio, the more equity’s return amplifies the difference between asset and debt returns.",
"The same logic applies to betas because CAPM links expected returns and betas linearly:\n  β_A = (D / (D + E)) * β_D + (E / (D + E)) * β_E.\nRearranging:\n  β_E = β_A + (D / E) * (β_A - β_D).\nIf debt is relatively low-beta (especially if close to risk-free so β_D ≈ 0), then β_E grows almost proportionally with D/E.",
"Key intuition: leverage doesn’t change the risk of the underlying business (β_A). It just concentrates that same business risk onto a smaller equity base. Like using margin in your brokerage account, you get bigger wins and bigger losses in percentage terms on your equity stake."
],
"key_takeaways": [
"Leverage amplifies equity’s exposure to asset risk because equity is a residual claimant: debt is paid first, equity gets whatever is left.",
"If asset risk (β_A) is positive and debt is relatively safe (low β_D), increasing D/E makes equity beta rise roughly in proportion to D/E.",
"Changing leverage does NOT change the operating risk of the business; it reallocates who bears that risk between debtholders and shareholders.",
"This is why high-leverage firms are much more sensitive to business cycle shocks: their equity betas are often well above 1."

{
"id": "qa-tax-shields-debt-rate",
"question": "Why do we usually discount tax shields at the debt rate rather than the equity rate?",
"topic": "Valuing Tax Shields",
"archetype": "A1-CapitalStructure",
"answer": [
"Tax shields arise because interest payments are tax-deductible: each dollar of interest paid saves τ dollars in corporate tax (where τ is the corporate tax rate).",
"These tax savings exist only as long as the firm is paying interest on outstanding debt and has positive taxable income to shield. That means tax shields are tied directly to the existence and risk of the debt, not to equity.",
"If the firm maintains a fixed nominal amount of debt (a bullet bond or a fixed amortization schedule) and the tax rate is stable and not strongly correlated with the market, then the risk of the tax shield is similar to the risk of the debt itself: the tax shield falls if the firm defaults (because interest isn’t paid), and it is received when the debt is honored.",
"Under those conditions, the appropriate discount rate for the tax shield is the expected return on that debt, r_D, not the equity rate r_E. Intuitively, someone who buys the debt is implicitly also buying the associated tax shield stream attached to that debt’s interest payments.",
"Formally, when debt is risky with default probability p, one classic approximation is:\n  NPV(TS) ≈ τ * r_D * D / (r_D + p),\nwhich treats tax shields as a risky bond-like cash flow discounted at a debt-like rate adjusted for default.",
"However, if the firm targets a constant debt ratio (D/A fixed), then the level of debt and thus the tax shield fluctuate with asset values. In that case, the tax shield has asset-like risk and should be discounted at something closer to r_A, the asset discount rate, not r_D.",
"Key principle: match the discount rate to the risk of the cash flow, not to who 'likes' or 'benefits from' the cash flow. For tax shields, that risk is usually debt-like when D is fixed in nominal terms and tax policy is stable."
