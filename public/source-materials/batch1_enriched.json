          "reasoning": "Zero-coupon debt backloads all promised payments into a single balloon payment at maturity. That increases both interest-rate risk (duration) and default risk, and can increase the firm’s reliance on refinancing when the large payment comes due.",
          "calculation": "Conceptual (no numeric calculation):\n• Duration: Zero-coupon debt pays everything at maturity, so its duration equals its maturity and is higher than for a coupon bond. Higher duration → more sensitivity of bond price to interest rate changes.\n• Default risk: With coupons, debtholders get some cash earlier; even if the firm later defaults, they have already recovered some value. A zero concentrates all default risk into one date: if the firm cannot make the one large payment, debtholders suffer a full default.\n• Refinancing risk: To meet the large bullet payment, the firm may need to roll over the zero into new debt at maturity. If capital markets are stressed then (e.g., spreads widened, banks unwilling to lend), refinancing might be difficult or very costly.",

This tends to amplify the sensitivity of debt value to systematic movements in the firm’s assets.",
          "calculation": "Conceptual (no numeric calculation):\n• Long-term debt is more equity-like: with more time, the probability that assets will be very high (making the debt almost risk-free) or very low (pushing into default) is greater, increasing sensitivity to macro shocks.\n• Option view: Debt can be seen as risk-free debt minus a put on the firm’s assets. A longer maturity increases the value of this put, which changes more with systematic shocks, raising β_D.\n• Comparison: For the same firm, 10-year debt will generally have a higher β_D than 1-year debt, because short-maturity debtholders are protected by the limited time window in which bad states can materialize.",

Then a shift to a riskier project no longer purely transfers value from debt to equity.\n• Shorter maturity: By shortening debt maturity, debtholders can force renegotiation or refinancing sooner, before managers have many opportunities to change the risk profile.\nAll of these designs try to ensure that project choice (Safe vs Risky) is driven by total firm value, not by the option-like payoff structure of existing equity alone.",
