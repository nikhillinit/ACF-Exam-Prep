SET 1 – Option Portfolio with Changed Strike and Current Price
Problem 1 – Changing the Strike Price

You hold the following portfolio on stock X:

Long 1 call on X with strike K = 110

Short 1 put on X with strike K = 90

Both options expire in 1 year

Current stock price S₀ = 100

Call premium paid today: $12

Put premium received today: $5

A. Draw and/or describe the net payoff at expiration as a function of the stock price 
𝑆

T
	​

. Identify key breakpoints and slopes.

B. How does the payoff shape differ if the call strike were K = 120 instead of 110, holding everything else fixed?

C. Intuition: Does raising the call strike make the portfolio riskier, safer, or neither? How does that relate to β and expected return?

Solution 1
A. Net payoff with K_call = 110, K_put = 90

Let’s break it into pieces.

Long 1 call at K=110: payoff at T = max(S_T − 110, 0)

Short 1 put at K=90: payoff at T = −max(90 − S_T, 0)

Case 1: 
𝑆
𝑇
≤
90
S
T
	​

≤90

Call: 0

Put: −(90 − S_T) = S_T − 90

Net payoff = S_T − 90

This is a line with slope +1, starting at −90 when S_T=0 and reaching 0 at S_T=90.

Case 2: 
90
<
𝑆
𝑇
<
110
90<S
T
	​

<110

Call: 0

Put: −0

Net payoff = 0

Flat line: payoff is 0 between S_T=90 and S_T=110.

Case 3: 
𝑆
𝑇
≥
110
S
T
	​

≥110

Call: S_T − 110

Put: 0

Net payoff = S_T − 110

Line with slope +1, equals 0 at S_T=110, increasing beyond that.

Shape:

For 
𝑆
𝑇
≤
90
S
T
	​

≤90: slope +1, line from ~−90 at 0 to 0 at 90

Between 90 and 110: flat at 0

For 
𝑆
𝑇
≥
110
S
T
	​

≥110: slope +1, starting at 0 at 110

That’s a “flat plateau” between 90 and 110, with up-sloping lines on both sides.

If you subtract the initial net cost (call cost 12 − put premium 5 = net cost 7), the profit is:

Profit = payoff − 7

So between 90–110 profit = −7; below 90 & above 110, profit slopes upward.

B. Changing the call strike from 110 → 120

Now suppose the call strike is K_call = 120, put still at 90.

Call payoff: max(S_T − 120, 0)
Put payoff: −max(90 − S_T, 0)

Breakpoints are now at 90 and 120.

Case 1: 
𝑆
𝑇
≤
90
S
T
	​

≤90

Net payoff = S_T − 90 (same as before).

Case 2: 
90
<
𝑆
𝑇
<
120
90<S
T
	​

<120

Call: 0

Put: 0

Net payoff = 0

Plateau region extends from 90 to 120 now, not 90 to 110.

Case 3: 
𝑆
𝑇
≥
120
S
T
	​

≥120

Net payoff = S_T − 120 (instead of S_T − 110 previously).

So differences vs original:

The flat region is wider (90 to 120 instead of 90 to 110).

The kink where upside begins moves from 110 to 120.

For a given high S_T (e.g., S_T = 150), net payoff is now lower:

Before: 150 − 110 = 40

Now: 150 − 120 = 30

So good states are less good: you capture upside later and get less of it for a given S_T.

C. Intuition: strike up → risk down

Raising the call strike from 110 → 120:

Moves your “upside” region to the right → you have less upside for moderate increases in stock price.

Makes the payoff more “flat” over a wider range of S_T (90 to 120).

For a given distribution of S_T, expected payoff (and expected return) falls, and β falls (less sensitivity to market-driven stock movements).

Intuitively:

The call is further out-of-the-money initially; you’re taking less levered exposure to the upside.

The portfolio is less risky (lower β, lower expected excess return) because the payoff is zero over a wider range and grows more slowly beyond the call strike.

SET 2 – Option Portfolio When Future Stock Prices Are More Volatile
Problem 2 – Changing the Distribution (70/130 vs 80/120)

Consider the portfolio from Solution 1A (K_call=110, K_put=90). Assume:

Risk-free rate is 2%.

Call + put portfolio initial cost is net $7 (as before).

Market is fairly priced so expected return matters.

Case A (original): future stock price is 80 or 120 with equal probability 50% each.

Case B (more volatile): future stock price is 70 or 130 with equal probability 50% each.

A. Compute the expected payoff and expected rate of return on the option portfolio in Case A (80/120).

B. Repeat for Case B (70/130).

C. Compare the expected returns and explain the intuition: how does higher underlying volatility affect the option portfolio’s expected return (and β)?

Solution 2

We use the payoff function from Set 1A:

For S_T ≤ 90: payoff = S_T − 90

90 < S_T < 110: payoff = 0

S_T ≥ 110: payoff = S_T − 110

Net cost = 7 → expected profit = E[payoff] − 7, expected return = profit / 7 (ignoring risk-free rate for simplicity of notation).

A. Case A – S_T ∈ {80, 120}

State 1: S_T = 80

80 ≤ 90 → payoff = 80 − 90 = −10

State 2: S_T = 120

≥110 → payoff = 120 − 110 = 10

Each state 50% probability:

Expected payoff = 0.5(−10) + 0.5(10) = 0

Expected profit = 0 − 7 = −7

Expected return = −7 / 7 = −100%

So under this toy distribution, the portfolio has zero expected payoff but negative expected return relative to its cost; you’re paying $7 for something that breaks even in payoff terms.

(If this were a realistic, fairly priced derivative, the initial cost would be set so expected profit is closer to the risk-free return; here the numbers are stylized.)

B. Case B – S_T ∈ {70, 130}

State 1: S_T = 70

70 ≤ 90 → payoff = 70 − 90 = −20

State 2: S_T = 130

≥110 → payoff = 130 − 110 = 20

Expected payoff:

E[payoff] = 0.5(−20) + 0.5(20) = 0 (same as before)

But magnitude of good and bad outcomes doubled:

Good state payoff: +20 vs +10

Bad state payoff: −20 vs −10

Yet expected payoff is still 0.

Expected profit (again ignoring discounting of initial cost):

E[profit] = 0 − 7 = −7

Expected return = −7 / 7 = −100% (same as before).

So numerically we made payoffs more extreme, but kept the distribution symmetric; expected payoff remains 0 and expected return remains −100% under this stylized setup.

C. Intuition: volatility ↑ → option value ↑ (for same price), β ↑

In a realistic setting with market-determined option prices, when underlying volatility rises:

For a given initial option price, expected payoff (in a risk-neutral sense) and option value typically increase (call and put become more valuable; you’re long volatility in this type of portfolio).

If prices adjust so that the option is fairly priced, the initial cost would rise to keep expected return consistent with CAPM; at a fixed old price, higher volatility would mean a higher expected payoff.

Even in this toy symmetric example:

Your payoff is more sensitive to underlying stock moves (−20/20 instead of −10/10).

The portfolio’s beta goes up: in boom states you earn more; in bust states you lose more → stronger comovement with the market.

Intuition: your position is more leveraged to underlying risk; with correctly priced options, higher volatility would be reflected in a higher initial cost for the same expected payoff.

So:

Raising dispersion from (80,120) to (70,130) increases risk/β and (if price didn’t adjust) would increase expected return because you have more upside in really good states; in a proper market, higher price would offset that so expected return per unit β matches CAPM.

SET 3 – Real Options: Coffee Café with Changed Cashflows

Recall the real options lecture:

Coffee café project in Chicago. Two possible “preference types”:

Berkeley-like: high coffee demand, expected cashflow = 22K.

Cleveland-like: low demand, expected cashflow = 12K.

Assumed some probabilities (e.g., p_B, p_C) and discount rate.

You computed:

Value without additional information (invest now).

Value with perfect market research (invest only in good state).

Value of information = difference.

Now we’ll tweak the cashflows and show what happens.

Problem 3 – Changing the Cashflows

Assume:

Discount rate: r = 10% (one-year horizon for simplicity).

Two possible types for Chicago:

Type B (Berkeley): one-year NPV of café = +30K (higher than before).

Type C (Cleveland): one-year NPV of café = −10K (worse than before).

Prior probabilities: P(B) = 60%, P(C) = 40%.

You must decide today whether to build the café or not. Alternatively, you can pay a consultant to perfectly reveal type (B vs C), then decide.

A. What is the NPV of investing now without information? (Invest today; pay cost, then receive state-dependent NPV.)

B. What is the value of the project with perfect information (you can invest only if B)?

C. What is the value of information from perfect research?

D. Intuition: how does changing cashflows (higher upside and lower downside vs original 22/12) affect:

NPV without info

NPV with info

Value of information?

Solution 3

We treat the NPV numbers (+30K and −10K) as already discounted one-year NPVs relative to cost. That is, if you build today, expected payoff in each state (considering all future years and discounting) is:

B: +30K

C: −10K

If that bothers you, think of them as PV at t=0; we’re not re-discounting further.

A. NPV of investing now (no info)

If you invest now, you’re stuck with B or C:

Expected NPV (no info) = P(B) * NPV_B + P(C) * NPV_C
= 0.6 × 30 + 0.4 × (−10)
= 18 − 4
= +14K

So NPV_no_info = +14K. Good project even without research.

B. Value with perfect information (invest only if B)

With perfect research:

If B (60%): you invest and get +30K.

If C (40%): you do not invest, NPV = 0.

Expected NPV with info:

NPV_with_info = 0.6 × 30 + 0.4 × 0 = 18K

So NPV_with_info = +18K.

C. Value of information

Value of info = NPV_with_info − NPV_no_info
= 18K − 14K = +4K

So paying anything less than 4K for perfect info would be positive-NPV (ignoring the cost of delay; we’re not discounting time here for simplicity).

D. Intuition: how did changing cashflows change the values?

Compare to the original lecture numbers (where NPV_B and NPV_C were closer, e.g., 22 and 12 or 32.3 and −27.8 in some versions):

Higher upside in B (+30K instead of +22) and lower (more negative) downside in C (−10K instead of, say, +12):

In our new numbers, B is more attractive; C is worse than before (negative vs small positive).

This increases the value of being able to avoid C, so it increases the NPV with info relative to no info.

NPV_no_info:

If the prior probability of good state is high (60%) and B is very good (+30), that pulls NPV_no_info up.

If C is negative but relatively modest (−10), the average NPV remains positive (+14).

NPV_with_info:

With info, you get all of the upside in B and avoid the negative C entirely. That’s always going to be at least as big as NPV_no_info, but the gap depends on:

Size of negative NPV in bad states,

Probability of bad states.

Value of information:

Magnitude of VOI depends on both how bad bad states are and how likely they are.

Here, by making C negative (instead of just smaller positive) we’ve made it more important to avoid the wrong project → VOI rises relative to a world where both states had positive NPV but different levels.

Key takeaway:

If you increase the dispersion between “good” and “bad” outcomes (higher upside in B and more negative downside in C), both NPV_no_info and NPV_with_info can change, but:

NPV_with_info always benefits from being able to avoid negative C.

Value of information tends to grow when:

Bad states are truly bad (negative or more negative), and

Those bad states have non-trivial probability.

SET 4 – CAPM & Regression: Changing Beta, Correlation, and Variance
Problem 4 – Schumpeter-Style Regression Twist

A fund is currently 50% in T-bills and 50% in the market index. It is considering adding a new stock Y.

You know:

Expected excess return on the market: 8%.

Risk-free rate: 4%.

The regression of Y’s excess returns on the market’s excess returns yields:

Case A:

β_Y = 1.2, R² = 0.80

Case B (new regression with changed data):

β_Y = 0.8, R² = 0.20

Assume that covariance with the market or correlation changes accordingly.

A. Under CAPM, what is the expected return of stock Y in Case A vs Case B?

B. How does the required return change, and what does that say about the stock’s risk?

C. Intuition: what does lowering β from 1.2 to 0.8 and R² from 0.80 to 0.20 mean for:

Systematic vs idiosyncratic risk

The stock’s role in a well-diversified portfolio?

B. Required return & risk change

In Case A, Y is riskier than the market (β>1) in systematic terms. It needs a higher expected return (13.6%) to compensate.

In Case B, Y is less risky in systematic terms (β<1). Required return is lower (10.4%).

So changing β from 1.2 to 0.8:

Lowers the stock’s market-related risk.

Lowers its required return / discount rate.

C. Intuition: β and R² changes

Lower β from 1.2 → 0.8:

Means Y’s average sensitivity to market moves is lower; when the market goes up/down, Y moves less on average.

Lower R² from 0.80 → 0.20:

Means only 20% of the variance of Y’s returns is explained by the market; 80% is idiosyncratic.

For a well-diversified investor:

Systematic risk (β) is what matters for expected return; idiosyncratic risk (1 − R² portion) is diversifiable and doesn’t earn a premium.

Case A: high β and high R² → a classic “high systematic risk” stock; expected return must be high.

Case B: lower β and low R² → a stock with modest systematic risk and lots of idiosyncratic noise; lower required return and potentially useful for diversification.

So by changing the regression numbers, you’ve changed:

The discount rate you’d use in NPV calculations.

The interpretation of Y’s risk: from “aggressive market stock” in Case A to “mildly pro-cyclical, noisy stock” in Case B.
