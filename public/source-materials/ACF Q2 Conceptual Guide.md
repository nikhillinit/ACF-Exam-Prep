\#\# SECTION 0 – How to Use This Document

\* This is meant to be a \*\*searchable\*\* reference:

\* Use \*\*Ctrl+F\*\* for keywords like \`alpha\`, \`dividend\`, \`underinvestment\`, \`covenants\`, \`real options\`, \`hedging\`, etc.

\* It’s structured into:

1\. \*\*Universal Q2 Answer Pattern\*\*

2\. \*\*Core Building Blocks\*\* (CAPM, M\&M, trade-off, etc.)

3\. \*\*Thematic Toolkits\*\* (A–I) with:

\* When to use

\* Key ideas & formulas

\* Rationale (why it matters)

\* Skeleton answers you can adapt

You do \*\*not\*\* need to memorize everything. The value is: any time you hit a conceptual question in practice, you can map it to a section here, absorb the logic, and reuse the patterns.

\---

\#\# SECTION 1 – Universal Pattern for ANY Q2 Part

\#\#\# 1.0 Command words: what the grader is asking for

Always start by reading the verb:

\* \*\*Define / distinguish\*\*

→ Clean definitions; maybe 1–2 sentence example.

\* \*\*Explain briefly\*\*

→ 3–5 sentences; hit principle, context, mechanism, conclusion.

\* \*\*Explain completely\*\* / \*\*True, False, or Uncertain – explain\*\*

→ Assume multiple forces; talk about at least \*\*two sides\*\* and then conclude.

\* \*\*Give two reasons / examples\*\*

→ Label them clearly: “Reason 1, Reason 2” or “Example 1, Example 2”.

For \*\*True / False / Uncertain\*\*:

\* Default safe stance is often \*\*“Uncertain: it depends”\*\*.

\* Show:

\* Conditions under which it’s true

\* Conditions under which it’s false

\* Then summarize which side dominates.

This is a very professor-friendly way to show you see nuance.

\---

\#\#\# 1.1 Step 1 – Identify the topic and framework

Most Q2 conceptual parts fall into one of these buckets:

\* \*\*CAPM / alpha / expected return / historical vs model\*\*

\* \*\*Economic vs financial distress; leverage; ratings; equity volatility\*\*

\* \*\*Project risk vs firm WACC; comparables; WACC misuse\*\*

\* \*\*Capital structure & taxes; trade-off theory; personal vs corporate taxes\*\*

\* \*\*Payout policy: dividends vs repurchases; signaling; clienteles; smoothing\*\*

\* \*\*Risk management: hedging vs speculation; swaps; caps; underinvestment; limited vs unlimited liability\*\*

\* \*\*Market efficiency & mispricing; wealth transfers\*\*

\* \*\*Real options / option to wait / value of information\*\*

\* \*\*Covenants & agency; wealth transfer between claimants\*\*

Once you know the bucket, you can choose the right toolkit (A–I below).

\---

\#\#\# 1.2 Step 2 – Map the story to “the big frameworks”

Ask yourself:

1\. \*\*What’s the clean benchmark?\*\*

\* CAPM:

(E\[R\_i\] \= r\_f \+ \\beta\_i \\times \\text{Market Risk Premium})

\* M\&M with no frictions:

\* Capital structure / payout \*\*do not\*\* affect firm value if investment policy is fixed.

\* Trade-off theory:

(V\_{\\text{levered}} \= V\_{\\text{unlevered}} \+ PV(\\text{Tax Shields}) – PV(\\text{Distress Costs}) – PV(\\text{Agency Costs}))

\* Real options: compare \*\*NPV(invest now)\*\* vs \*\*expected NPV(wait & condition)\*\*.

2\. \*\*Which M\&M assumptions are broken here?\*\*

\* Corporate taxes?

\* Personal taxes?

\* Financial distress costs?

\* Transaction / issuance costs?

\* Agency problems (manager vs shareholder, debt vs equity)?

\* Information asymmetry / mispricing?

\* Investor non-diversification / special clienteles?

Everything in this guide is basically: “What changes once we bring in these frictions?”

\---

\#\#\# 1.3 Step 3 – Structure your answer (3 blocks)

For almost any Q2 answer, you can use this skeleton:

1\. \*\*Principle / Definition (1–2 sentences)\*\*

\* Give a clean definition or the main theory.

\* “In M\&M with no frictions, payout policy doesn’t affect firm value if investment is fixed…”

2\. \*\*Context \+ Mechanism (3–6 sentences)\*\*

\* Tie that principle to the facts in the question.

\* Identify which friction is relevant (taxes, distress, info, agency).

\* Explain what goes up/down and why.

3\. \*\*Conclusion (1–2 sentences)\*\*

\* Directly answering the question with the wording mirrored.

\* “Therefore, this does \*\*not\*\* prove that dividend policy is ‘relevant’ in the M\&M sense; the price reaction reflects information, not payout mechanics.”

If asked for “two reasons,” structure the \*\*Context+Mechanism\*\* block as “Reason 1:” / “Reason 2:”.

\---

\#\# SECTION 2 – Core Building Blocks (Conceptual primitives)

These are the things you’ll refer to again and again in toolkits.

\---

\#\#\# 2.1 CAPM and Expected Return Basics

\* \*\*Formula:\*\*

(E\[R\_i\] \= r\_f \+ \\beta\_i \\times (E\[R\_M\] \- r\_f))

\* \*\*Interpretation:\*\*

\* (r\_f): compensation for time value of money.

\* (\\beta\_i): measure of \*\*systematic\*\* (market-related) risk.

\* Market Risk Premium: compensation per unit β.

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

CAPM says the only risk you get compensated for (in expected return) is systematic risk. This is why β is central for discount rates and required returns.

\---

\#\#\# 2.2 M\&M Capital Structure Baseline

M\&M (without tax, distress, or agency):

\* Capital structure is irrelevant:

\* (V\_L \= V\_U) (levered value \= unlevered value) if investment policy is fixed, markets are perfect, and risk is properly priced.

\* Changing D/E just changes the risk (and required return) on equity, not total firm value.

With \*\*corporate tax\*\*:

\* Value of levered firm:

(V\_L \= V\_U \+ T\_c \\times D) (if perpetual risk-free debt, simple case).

\* So debt adds value because interest is tax-deductible.

\---

\#\#\# 2.3 Trade-off Theory

Real firms face:

\* \*\*Benefits of debt:\*\*

\* Interest tax shields.

\* Potential discipline on managers (less free cash).

\* \*\*Costs of debt:\*\*

\* Expected financial distress costs (legal, operational, reputational).

\* Agency costs (risk-shifting, debt overhang).

\* Loss of financial flexibility.

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

There is an \*\*optimal leverage\*\* where marginal tax benefits \= marginal expected distress \+ agency costs. So optimal D/E is \*\*not\*\* zero and \*\*not\*\* 100%.

\---

\#\#\# 2.4 Economic vs Financial Distress

\* \*\*Economic distress\*\*: assets/cashflows are weak (low demand, low margins, obsolete tech). Happens regardless of how firm is financed.

\* \*\*Financial distress\*\*: trouble meeting \*\*contractual obligations\*\* (interest, principal). Triggers default risk, covenant breach, bankruptcy processes.

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

Leverage converts economic bad states into financial distress states and adds extra deadweight costs (lawyers, disruption, fire-sales).

\---

\#\#\# 2.5 Real Options, Option to Wait, VOI

Think of investment as an option:

\* \*\*Invest now:\*\*

Compute NPV now.

\* \*\*Wait:\*\*

\* In future, observe state (e.g., demand high/low).

\* Choose whether to invest based on NPV state-by-state.

Option value:

\* Value(wait) \= Prob(good) × NPV\_if\_invest \+ Prob(bad) × 0 (if you skip).

\* VOI (value of information) \= Value(wait) – NPV(now).

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

Flexibility is most valuable when uncertainty is high and information arrives \*\*before\*\* you must commit.

\---

\#\#\# 2.6 Agency and Information Problems

\* \*\*Agency\*\* (manager vs shareholder, equity vs debt):

\* Managers may be too risk-averse, empire-build, or chase perks.

\* Equity vs debt: risk-shifting (taking more risk), debt overhang (underinvestment).

\* \*\*Information asymmetry\*\*:

\* Managers know more about firm value than investors.

\* Equity issues at pooled prices can transfer wealth if stock is mispriced → adverse selection.

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

These frictions strongly shape financing choices (pecking order), hedging, payout, and project acceptance.

\---

\#\# SECTION 3 – Thematic Toolkits (A–I)

Below: the detailed toolkits. Each has: when to use, key ideas, rationales, and answer skeletons.

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit A – CAPM, Alpha, Historical Averages, Mispricing

\*\*Use when:\*\* you see words like “beta”, “expected return”, “alpha”, “CAPM”, “market risk premium”, “Sharpe ratio”, or “historical vs required return”.

\---

\#\#\#\# A1. CAPM expected return

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Given β, r\_f, and market risk premium, what is expected return?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

1\. State formula:

\* “Under CAPM, the required return is (E\[R\_i\] \= r\_f \+ \\beta\_i \\times \\text{MRP}).”

2\. Plug numbers \+ show one line of arithmetic.

3\. Conclude:

\* “So the required/expected return for this stock is X%.”

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

This is the discount rate you must use to value that stock or project if risk is priced correctly.

\---

\#\#\#\# A2. Is a given portfolio “attractive”? (alpha)

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Portfolio β=1.3, expected return 13%. Is this attractive vs CAPM?”

\*\*Strategy:\*\*

1\. Compute CAPM required return at that β.

2\. Compare the offered/realized return to CAPM return.

3\. Compute alpha \= Offered − CAPM.

4\. Interpret.

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle: “Under CAPM, a β of 1.3 requires (E\[R\] \= r\_f \+ 1.3×\\text{MRP}).”

\* Context: “That gives X%. The portfolio offers 13%.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Alpha \= 13% − X%. If alpha \> 0, the portfolio has outperformed what CAPM says it should earn given its systematic risk.”

\* Implication:

\* “In an efficient market, this might be due to sampling error or omitted risk factors, not guaranteed free money. If we believe mispricing, a positive alpha indicates undervaluation and the portfolio is attractive to overweight in a diversified portfolio.”

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

You are showing you can compare risk-adjusted performance vs a model benchmark.

\---

\#\#\#\# A3. Historical average returns vs CAPM

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Should we use historical average return or CAPM? Why can historical averages be misleading? Why is CAPM preferred, and what are CAPM’s limits?”

\*\*Strategy:\*\*

1\. List problems with pure historical averages.

2\. Explain CAPM benefits (model-consistent ex-ante required returns).

3\. Acknowledge CAPM limitations.

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Historical averages are backward-looking and can be distorted by survivorship bias, regime changes, and noise in finite samples.”

\* Context:

\* “Past 10-year average returns may not reflect current risk-free rates or risk premia, especially if the firm’s risk profile or macro conditions have changed.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “CAPM ties required returns to current risk-free rates and systematic risk (β), enforcing consistency across projects and firms. It’s more appropriate for ex-ante discount rates, especially for projects with risk differing from the firm’s historical mix.”

\* Caveats:

\* “CAPM is a simplification; β estimates are noisy and the single-factor model can’t fully explain returns (size, value, momentum matter). In practice, we can use CAPM as a baseline and cross-check with historical evidence.”

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

You’re showing you understand both the statistical drawbacks of simple averages and the modeling assumptions of CAPM.

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit B – Economic vs Financial Distress, Leverage, Ratings

\*\*Use when:\*\* you see “distress”, “sales fall”, “leverage”, “volatile earnings”, “credit ratings”, “financial crisis”, “equity volatility”.

\---

\#\#\#\# B1. Distinguish economic vs financial distress

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Define economic vs financial distress; give an example of each; can you have economic distress without financial distress?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Economic distress means the \*\*business\*\* is doing poorly: low demand, low margins, obsolete products. Financial distress means trouble meeting \*\*financial obligations\*\* such as interest and principal.”

\* Context (example):

\* “Here, a 40% drop in sales and cancellation of expansion plans is economic distress—the asset side is suffering. Missing interest payments or renegotiating loans under duress would be financial distress.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Leverage is what converts economic bad states into financial distress; with little or no debt, firms can have economic distress but never financial distress.”

\* Implication:

\* “So an all-equity firm can absolutely have economic distress without financial distress; a highly levered firm can quickly move from economic to financial distress.”

\---

\#\#\#\# B2. Leverage and equity beta/volatility

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Why is Firm B’s equity beta higher than Firm A’s, given same assets but higher leverage?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Asset beta reflects business risk. Leverage just slices those asset cash flows differently between debt and equity.”

\* Context:

\* “Firm B uses 40% debt; its equity is a smaller slice of the total value but still bears all residual fluctuations.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Equity \= Assets − Debt. A 10% change in asset value translates into a larger percentage change in equity value when debt is fixed. This levered residual claim is more sensitive to the market, so β\_E \> β\_A.”

\* Implication:

\* “Thus, Firm B’s equity beta is higher even though both firms have identical business risk; leverage amplifies equity’s exposure to underlying asset risk.”

\---

\#\#\#\# B3. Same leverage, different ratings

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Two firms have the same D/E but different credit ratings. How?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Ratings measure probability of default, not just book leverage. They incorporate cash flow risk and recovery prospects.”

\* Context:

\* “Company A may have stable, predictable cash flows and tangible collateral; Company B may be in a volatile industry, with lower margins and less tangible assets.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Even with identical D/E, the firm with more volatile, less predictable cash flows, weaker coverage, and less valuable collateral has a higher probability of default and thus a lower rating.”

\* Implication:

\* “So leverage ratios must be interpreted in the context of business risk, asset characteristics, and profitability; ratings can differ markedly despite similar D/E.”

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit C – Project Discount Rate vs Firm WACC; Misusing WACC

\*\*Use when:\*\* you see “project-specific risk”, “β\_project”, “comparable pure-play firms”, “new business line”, “WACC error”.

\---

\#\#\#\# C1. Why project discount rate ≠ firm-wide WACC

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Why is it wrong to use the firm’s 9% WACC for a low-risk or high-risk project? What error does that create?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “The discount rate should match the \*\*systematic risk of the project’s cashflows\*\*, not the average risk of the firm’s existing portfolio.”

\* Context:

\* “Project A is safer than the firm (low β), Project B is riskier (high β). Using the same 9% WACC for both ignores these differences.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “For Project A (low risk), a 9% discount rate is too high → NPV is biased downward → you may reject a positive NPV safe project. For Project B (high risk), a 9% rate is too low → NPV is biased upward → you may accept a risky negative NPV project.”

\* Implication:

\* “Over time, using firm-wide WACC leads to a distorted portfolio: too few safe projects and too many risky ones. The firm drifts into a higher-risk profile than intended and destroys value.”

\---

\#\#\#\# C2. Using comparables to get project discount rate

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“How would you estimate the appropriate discount rate for a cloud computing project using pure-play comparables?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “We want a discount rate reflecting the project’s β, which we estimate from comparable firms in the same business line.”

\* Context:

\* “Pure-play cloud firms have equity β around 1.4 and no debt; this β is a good proxy for the cloud asset β.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Use CAPM: (r\_{\\text{project}} \= r\_f \+ β\_{\\text{project}} × \\text{MRP}). Since comparables are all-equity, their equity β ≈ asset β. So (r\_{\\text{project}} \= 3% \+ 1.4 × 7% \= 12.8%).”

\* Implication:

\* “The firm should discount the cloud project cashflows at \~12.8%, not at its lower existing WACC, to correctly reflect higher risk.”

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit D – Capital Structure, Taxes, Trade-Off, Personal vs Corporate tax

\*\*Use when:\*\* you see “tax advantage of debt”, “why not 100% debt”, “personal vs corporate taxes”, “beta and WACC after recap”.

\---

\#\#\#\# D1. Tax advantage of debt with corporate and personal taxes

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“How can personal taxes reduce or reverse the tax advantage of debt?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “With corporate taxes only, debt adds value via the interest tax shield: roughly (T\_c × D) for perpetual, risk-free debt. Equity payouts aren’t deductible.”

\* Context:

\* “At the investor level, interest income may be taxed at a higher rate than equity income (dividends and capital gains).”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Higher personal tax on interest means investors demand a higher pre-tax return on debt, offsetting some or all of the corporate tax advantage. When you multiply corporate and personal tax wedges, the net tax advantage of debt can be much smaller than (T\_c), and in extreme cases can even become negative.”

\* Implication:

\* “Thus, once you consider both corporate and personal taxes, optimal leverage is generally lower than in a simple ‘corporate-tax-only’ M\&M world, and in some tax systems equity can be tax-favored overall.”

\---

\#\#\#\# D2. Leverage, equity β, and firm value

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“If the firm recapitalizes with more debt and equity’s required return rises, does that mean firm value fell?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Increasing leverage increases equity risk and required return, but if debt is cheaper and you ignore frictions, the firm’s total cost of capital (WACC) can remain unchanged (M\&M without taxes) or even decline slightly (with taxes).”

\* Context:

\* “After the recap, equity β rises, so CAPM gives a higher r\_E. But the firm also replaced expensive equity with cheaper debt, and interest may be tax-deductible.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “The fact that equity now demands a higher return is compensation for higher risk per dollar of equity; it doesn’t automatically mean that the weighted average required return on the firm’s cashflows (WACC) has risen.”

\* Implication:

\* “So you can’t infer from r\_E alone that firm value fell; you must look at \*\*WACC\*\* and expected cashflows. Only if WACC rises or cashflows deteriorate would firm value decline.”

\---

\#\#\#\# D3. Why not 100% debt?

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“If debt reduces taxes, why don’t firms finance entirely with debt?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Trade-off theory says optimal leverage balances tax benefits against expected distress and agency costs.”

\* Mechanism (list distinct reasons):

\* “First, as leverage rises, the probability and cost of \*\*financial distress\*\* increase; bankruptcy and restructuring are expensive and can destroy goodwill, customers, and supplier relationships.”

\* “Second, very high leverage creates \*\*underinvestment (debt overhang)\*\*: equityholders may refuse positive NPV projects if most benefits flow to creditors.”

\* “Third, high leverage reduces \*\*financial flexibility\*\* and magnifies risk for equity; future financing becomes more difficult, and covenant constraints tighten.”

\* (Optionally mention risk-shifting, agency costs, and constraints in raising debt.)

\* Implication:

\* “Optimal leverage is typically moderate, not zero and not 100%. Even very profitable, stable firms choose some leverage but stop before expected distress and agency costs outweigh tax shields.”

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit E – Payout Policy: Dividends, Repurchases, Signaling

\*\*Use when:\*\* “dividend increase”, “stock jumps at announcement”, “smoothing dividends”, “high-growth wants to pay dividends”, “repurchase above/below intrinsic value”.

\---

\#\#\#\# E1. Dividend irrelevance vs real-world payout relevance

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Does a 5% price jump after a dividend increase prove that dividend policy is relevant in M\&M sense?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “In M\&M world with no taxes, transaction costs, or information problems, payout policy (dividends vs repurchases vs retention) does not affect firm value if investment policy is fixed.”

\* Context:

\* “Here, the firm’s dividend increase surprised investors and the stock price jumped.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “That price reaction likely reflects \*\*new information\*\*: investors interpret a higher, sustainable dividend as a signal that management expects higher future cashflows or has fewer negative NPV projects. The value change is coming from updated beliefs about cashflows, not merely the mechanical act of paying out cash.”

\* Implication:

\* “So the event does \*\*not\*\* prove that payout is relevant in the strict M\&M sense. It shows payout can be \*informative\* in a world with information asymmetry and agency frictions.”

\---

\#\#\#\# E2. Why prices react to dividend changes (two reasons)

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Give two reasons why stock prices react to dividend increases or cuts.”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Reason 1 – \*\*Signaling:\*\*

\* “Managers are reluctant to increase dividends unless they believe higher earnings are sustainable, because cutting later is very costly reputationally. So an increase signals management confidence about long-term cashflows; a cut signals the opposite.”

\* Reason 2 – \*\*Agency / Clienteles:\*\*

\* “Dividends can reduce free cash under managerial control and mitigate overinvestment, reassuring investors that excess cash won’t be wasted. Additionally, some investor clienteles (retirees, income funds) prefer stable cash payouts and may pay a premium for dividend-paying stocks.”

\---

\#\#\#\# E3. High-growth firms and dividends

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Should a high-growth firm with many positive NPV projects initiate a dividend?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “When investment opportunities are plentiful and internal cash is scarce, every dollar paid out is a dollar that may need to be raised externally at a cost, or a dollar of positive NPV projects foregone.”

\* Context:

\* “The firm has numerous positive NPV projects and significant R\&D needs, but investor pressure for dividends.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Paying dividends may force the firm to issue costly equity (with potential mispricing) or debt, or to pass up profitable projects. While dividends can signal confidence and reduce agency problems, for a young growth firm the main challenge is financing its pipeline, not returning cash to investors.”

\* Implication:

\* “So the optimal policy is often to \*\*refrain from steady dividends\*\*, communicate the value of growth opportunities, possibly consider occasional \*\*special dividends\*\* when cash truly exceeds good project needs, and rely more on capital gains than regular payout.”

\---

\#\#\#\# E4. Repurchases and intrinsic value (wealth transfers)

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Repurchasing shares at $50 when intrinsic value is $40. Who wins, who loses?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “When a firm repurchases shares at a price different from intrinsic value, wealth is transferred between selling and remaining shareholders.”

\* Context:

\* “Here, the firm pays $50 for something truly worth $40.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “Shareholders who sell into the repurchase receive more than intrinsic value and gain $10 per share. Remaining shareholders now own a firm that has spent too much cash: assets dropped by $50 per share bought back while intrinsic value per remaining share falls.”

\* Implication:

\* “Thus, repurchases at prices \*\*above intrinsic value\*\* benefit sellers at the expense of continuing shareholders; repurchases below intrinsic value do the opposite.”

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit F – Risk Management: Hedging vs Speculation, Underinvestment, Liability

\*\*Use when:\*\* “hedge”, “swap”, “futures”, “derivatives”, “CFO thinks X”, “underinvestment”, “close to distress”, “unlimited liability”.

\---

\#\#\#\# F1. Hedging vs speculation diagnostic

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Is this swap/futures position hedging or speculation?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Hedging aims to \*\*reduce the variance\*\* of firm value or cashflows by offsetting existing exposures. Speculation aims to \*\*profit from expected price movements\*\*, increasing or creating exposures.”

\* Context:

\* “The firm has floating-rate debt and enters a pay-fixed, receive-floating swap.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “If the goal is to stabilize total interest expense regardless of rate moves, aligning derivative cashflows with debt exposure, this is hedging. If the CFO’s rationale is ‘we think rates will fall but want to lock in 4.5% now’, that’s actually betting against the market’s view: they’re \*\*speculating\*\* on interest rates rather than just reducing risk.”

\* Implication:

\* “On the exam, clearly distinguish: does the position \*\*offset\*\* a risky exposure or \*\*double down\*\* on a view? Answer accordingly.”

\---

\#\#\#\# F2. Hedging’s real goal: state reshaping, not expected profit

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“What is the main goal of risk management? Does hedging increase expected profits?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “In efficient markets, derivatives are fairly priced; hedging is close to zero NPV in expectation. The main goal is to \*\*reshuffle payoffs across states of the world\*\*, not increase average cashflows.”

\* Context:

\* “Hedging fuel or FX exposure changes when the firm receives or pays cash across good and bad states.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “By transferring some payoff from good states (where the firm can afford to lose) to bad states (when it’s fragile and near distress), hedging reduces the probability and cost of financial distress, and helps ensure the firm can fund valuable investments in bad times.”

\* Implication:

\* “Hedging can \*\*increase firm value\*\* through lowered distress costs and reduced underinvestment, even though expected cashflow doesn’t change much.”

\---

\#\#\#\# F3. Underinvestment and hedging

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“How can hedging reduce underinvestment (debt overhang)?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Underinvestment arises when equityholders near distress reject positive NPV projects because most benefits go to existing debt.”

\* Context:

\* “ChemCorp near covenant violation; commodity prices could drop, making it unable to invest.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “If commodity price risk is hedged, cashflows in bad states are higher and more predictable; this reduces covenant breach probability and increases free cash available even in downturns. When potential projects appear, equity sees more of their NPV instead of that value being consumed by avoiding default.”

\* Implication:

\* “So hedging can align equity’s incentives with total firm value and encourage investment in good projects, mitigating debt overhang.”

\---

\#\#\#\# F4. Liability type: limited vs unlimited

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“Why might owners with unlimited liability hedge more?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Limited liability equityholders have payoffs like a call option on firm value; their downside is capped at their equity investment, while upside is unlimited.”

\* Context:

\* “In a partnership with unlimited liability, owners are on the hook with their \*\*personal wealth\*\* if the firm’s obligations exceed its assets.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “When liability is limited, equity often \*\*likes\*\* volatility—more variance raises option value. With unlimited liability, downside risk is far more severe and not capped, so owners are strongly motivated to reduce tail risk via insurance or hedging.”

\* Implication:

\* “Expect partnerships (law firms, professional practices) to hedge more aggressively and hold more insurance than widely held corporations with limited-liability shareholders.”

\---

\#\#\# Toolkit G – Market Efficiency, Mispricing, Wealth Transfers

\*\*Use when:\*\* “negative alpha”, “overvalued vs undervalued”, “issuing equity vs debt when mispriced”, “repurchases vs new shares”.

\---

\#\#\#\# G1. Interpreting negative alpha

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“A CAPM regression yields α \= −2%, β \= 1.3. Interpret.”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Alpha measures the return in excess of what CAPM predicts for a given β; negative alpha means the stock underperformed its CAPM benchmark.”

\* Context:

\* “With β \= 1.3, CAPM predicted X%; realized return was X−2%.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “If you believe markets are efficient and CAPM roughly correct, this is likely statistical noise or CAPM missing relevant risk factors. If you allow for mispricing, a persistent negative alpha suggests the stock has been overpriced and delivered too little return relative to its risk.”

\* Implication:

\* “A diversified investor might underweight such a stock; an active manager convinced of mispricing might short or avoid it, but needs to be cautious because alpha estimates are noisy.”

\---

\#\#\#\# G2. Equity issuance under mispricing

\*\*Question pattern:\*\*

“If managers believe stock is undervalued, how should that affect equity vs debt issuance? What about overvalued stock?”

\*\*Answer skeleton:\*\*

\* Principle:

\* “Managers acting in the interests of existing shareholders should avoid issuing new equity when the stock is \*\*underpriced\*\*, and prefer equity when it is \*\*overpriced\*\*.”

\* Context:

\* “Issuing equity at undervalued prices sells existing shareholders’ claim too cheaply; issuing at overvalued prices allows existing shareholders to transfer wealth from new investors.”

\* Mechanism:

\* “When stock is undervalued, Pecking Order theory predicts the firm will prefer internal funds or debt rather than equity. When stock is overvalued, equity issuance is attractive because new investors overpay for claims on future cashflows.”

\* Implication:

\* “Financing choices can be used to exploit mispricing; however, systematic reliance on equity issuance signals may itself become a signal to the market (equity issues can be read as ‘firm thinks stock is overvalued’).”

\#\#\# Toolkit H – Real Options & Value of Information

\*\*Use when:\*\* “option to wait”, “market research before investing”, “survey results”.

\*\*Skeleton:\*\*

\* State the two strategies: invest now vs wait.

\* Compute NPV for both (as described in Section 2.5).

\* Highlight that waiting is more valuable the more \*\*uncertain\*\* the environment and the more likely you can learn something that changes your decision.

\#\#\# Toolkit I – Covenants & Agency (Debt vs Equity)

\*\*Use when:\*\* “dividend restrictions”, “asset sale restrictions”, “borrowing limits”, “negative pledge”.

\*\*Skeleton:\*\*

\* Explain the \*\*agency problem\*\* covenants target:

\* Equity might pay big dividends leaving little collateral, issue new senior debt, or switch to very risky projects after debt is in place.

\* Covenants constrain those actions, making debt safer.

\* Safer debt lowers required return → raises firm value.

\* There is a trade-off: covenants can also restrict \*\*good\*\* actions in some states (lost flexibility). But ex-ante, both debt and equity can benefit when covenants are well-designed.

\#\# SECTION 4 – How to Use This in Practice

\#\#\# During practice:

\* For each Q2 part in your mocks:

1\. Identify topic (CAPM / distress / WACC / payout / hedging / etc.).

2\. Search this doc for the relevant toolkit.

3\. Read the skeleton answer and rationale.

4\. Then write your own 3–5 bullet version without looking, and compare.

\#\#\# During the exam:

\* You won’t reread this whole doc. Instead, you’ll have:

\* The \*\*Quick Reference\*\* with the 7 Themes \+ 3–5 bullet framework.

\* This doc internalized as mental patterns.

If during the exam you get a weird Q2 you haven’t seen before, ask:

1\. What is this really about? (CAPM, trade-off, info, agency, etc.)

2\. Which M\&M assumption is broken?

3\. How does that change the conclusion vs the frictionless benchmark?
