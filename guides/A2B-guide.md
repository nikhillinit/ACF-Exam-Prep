## 5-Step Workflow

### IDENTIFY (30s)
- Scan for: "asymmetric information", "equity issue", "pecking order", "Myers-Majluf"
- Check for: Problem-specific signals
- Flag: Hybrid if combined with other archetypes

### EXTRACT (30s)
- Core question: What is being asked?
- Sub-parts: Break down multi-part questions
- Data: List all given values and assumptions

### MAP (30s)
- Resource: Excel Tab 2_Multi_State_Project
- Verify: Do you have all necessary inputs?
- Plan: Identify calculation sequence

### EXECUTE (12 min)
- Follow template: Input values carefully
- Calculate: Work through systematically
- Multi-step: Handle dependencies in order

### CHECK (1-2 min)
- Sign: Does the direction make sense?
- Magnitude: Is the scale reasonable?
- Theory: Does it align with financial principles?
- Implications: Can you explain the result?
