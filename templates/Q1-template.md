# [Problem Title - Q1 Foundational Concept]

[Problem statement goes here. Provide context, given data, and setup for the question.]

**Given Information:**
- Parameter 1: Value
- Parameter 2: Value
- Parameter 3: Value

**Corporate tax rate:** 30%

## Part A

Calculate [specific metric or value requested].

### Solution

**Reasoning:** Explain the conceptual approach. Why are we using this method? What formula applies?

**Calculation:** Show the mathematical work step by step.
Example:
```
NPV = CF0 + CF1/(1+r) + CF2/(1+r)^2
    = -100 + 30/1.10 + 30/1.10^2
    = -100 + 27.27 + 24.79
    = -47.94
```

**Answer:** [Final numerical answer with units]
