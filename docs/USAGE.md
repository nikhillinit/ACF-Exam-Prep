# Usage Guide

## Navigation

The ACF Exam Prep System has three main modes:

### 1. Reconnaissance Mode (Default)

**Purpose**: Rapid exam question analysis and execution planning

**Workflow**:
1. Paste exam problem text into the input area
2. Click "Scan & Identify Archetypes"
3. Review scan results:
   - Identified archetypes
   - Tier classification
   - Hybrid detection
   - Keyword matches
4. Follow the generated execution plan:
   - Resource mapping (Excel + Playbook)
   - Time allocation strategy
   - Hybrid solving sequence (if applicable)

**Pro Tips**:
- Scan problems during the first 5 minutes of the exam
- Use reconnaissance to prioritize Tier 1 questions first
- Note hybrid problems early for proper time budgeting

### 2. Practice Mode

**Purpose**: Timed problem-solving with workflow guidance

**Features**:
- Full mock exam simulations (180-minute timer)
- Individual problem practice
- Tier filtering (focus on Tier 1 or 2)
- Real-time workflow step tracking
- Solution verification

**Best Practices**:
- Start with single Tier 1 problems
- Progress to hybrid questions
- Complete 3-5 full mock exams before real exam
- Track recognition speed (<30s goal)

### 3. Review Mode

**Purpose**: Performance analysis and gap identification

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Recognition speed by archetype
- Execution accuracy (% correct)
- Time management efficiency
- Tier 1 vs Tier 2 performance
- Hybrid handling success rate

**Gap Analysis**:
- Identifies weakest archetypes
- Recommends focused practice
- Shows progress over time
- Flags common error patterns

## The 5-Step Workflow

### Step 1: IDENTIFY (30 seconds)
- **Goal**: Determine archetype(s) and tier
- **Actions**:
  - Highlight keywords
  - Match to archetype database
  - Note if hybrid (2+ archetypes)
- **Checkpoints**:
  - [ ] Keywords identified
  - [ ] Archetype determined
  - [ ] Tier noted (1 or 2)
  - [ ] Hybrid components listed (if applicable)

### Step 2: EXTRACT (30 seconds)
- **Goal**: Understand core question
- **Actions**:
  - Read full problem
  - Identify sub-questions (Parts A, B, C, etc.)
  - Write margin note of core ask
- **Checkpoints**:
  - [ ] Core question restated in own words
  - [ ] All parts identified
  - [ ] Key assumptions noted

### Step 3: MAP (30 seconds)
- **Goal**: Select correct resources
- **Actions**:
  - Quantitative → Excel tab
  - Conceptual → Playbook theme
  - Verify assumptions (use archetype checklist)
- **Checkpoints**:
  - [ ] Resource identified (Excel OR Playbook)
  - [ ] Assumptions verified
  - [ ] Template modifications planned

### Step 4: EXECUTE (Variable)
- **Goal**: Solve using archetype recipe
- **Actions**:
  - Open Excel tab or Playbook
  - Populate inputs (blue cells)
  - Run calculations
  - For hybrid: solve each stage sequentially
- **Checkpoints**:
  - [ ] Following template structure
  - [ ] Intermediate checks passing
  - [ ] Sub-problems linked correctly (if hybrid)

### Step 5: CHECK (1-2 minutes)
- **Goal**: Verify correctness
- **Actions**:
  - Sign check (positive/negative as expected?)
  - Magnitude check (reasonable range?)
  - Theory link (connect to M&M, CAPM, etc.)
  - Implications (so what?)
- **Checkpoints**:
  - [ ] Sign correct
  - [ ] Magnitude reasonable
  - [ ] Theory referenced
  - [ ] Implications stated

## Archetype Recognition Tips

### High-Confidence Keywords

| Archetype | Instant Triggers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| A1 | "default" + "coupon" + "YTM" |
| A2A | "multi-state" + "existing debt" |
| A2B | "asymmetric information" + "equity issue" |
| A3 | "beta" + "unlever" + "discount rate" |
| A4 | "senior" + "junior" + "waterfall" |
| A5 | "dividend" + "repurchase" |
| A6 | "hedge" + "collar" OR "cap" |

### Hybrid Indicators

Watch for phrases like:
- "First, find the discount rate..." → A3 then others
- "...existing debt..." → Likely A2A hybrid
- "senior and junior tranches" → A1 + A4 hybrid
- "requires two steps" → Hybrid flag

## Time Management

### Exam Reconnaissance (First 5 minutes)
1. Skim all questions
2. Identify archetypes using keywords
3. Mark Tier 1 questions
4. Plan question order:
   - Tier 1 first
   - Save Tier 2 for end
   - Leave hardest for last

### Per-Question Budget (Rule of Thumb: 1 point = 1 minute)

| Points | Time Budget | Includes |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 20 pts | 20-22 min | Execution + checks |
| 40 pts | 40-45 min | Hybrid or multi-part |
| 60 pts | 60-65 min | Complex multi-stage |

Always add 5-minute buffer for final checks.

## Excel Integration

### Template Usage
1. Locate correct tab (via reconnaissance)
2. Input parameters in BLUE cells only
3. Verify formulas auto-populate
4. Extract outputs (usually highlighted in YELLOW)
5. Copy key results to exam paper

### Common Modifications
- **Multi-bond**: Use expanded rows for multiple tranches
- **Amortizing debt**: Adjust principal schedule
- **Off-par bonds**: Use price-to-yield calculator first

## Conceptual Answers (Q2 Style)

### 3-5 Bullet Structure
1. **Principle**: State the relevant theory (M&M, CAPM, etc.)
2. **Context**: Apply to specific situation in problem
3. **Mechanism**: Explain WHY/HOW it works
4. **Implications**: State the practical conclusion
5. **Caveats** (optional): Note assumptions or exceptions

**Example**:
> **Q**: Does leverage affect firm value?
> 
> **A**:
> 1. **Principle**: Under M&M with taxes, leverage creates value via tax shields
> 2. **Context**: HAL's $500M debt generates annual interest tax deductions
> 3. **Mechanism**: Tax savings = τ × Interest = 25% × $30M = $7.5M/year
> 4. **Implications**: Optimal leverage balances tax benefits against distress costs
> 5. **Caveat**: Assumes debt is stable; refinancing risk may reduce value

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Goals
- Week 1-2: Master all Tier 1 archetypes individually
- Week 3: Hybrid question practice
- Week 4: Full mock exams (3-5 complete)
- Final week: Rapid review + conceptual themes

### Success Metrics
- Recognition: <30s for Tier 1, <60s for Tier 2
- Accuracy: >95% Tier 1, >85% Tier 2
- Speed: Complete problems within time budget
- Workflow: Execute all 5 steps without skipping
